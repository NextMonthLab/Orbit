Strong progress. Those two epics were the non-negotiables, and you’ve done them in the right order. Nice work.

Now, to your question: which next?

Short answer

👉 Do EPIC 2 (Upgrade Continuity) next.

Why EPIC 2 comes before EPIC 3

You’re at a point where people can now safely pay. The next biggest risk is what it feels like immediately after they do.

Right now, the highest-impact failure mode is not:
	•	accidental churn
	•	subscription edge cases
	•	billing lifecycle bugs

It’s this:

“I paid… and I’m not sure what just happened.”

That’s a conversion killer.

How the epics stack logically

Here’s the correct sequencing now that EPIC 1 & 4 are done:

✅ EPIC 1 – Revenue Protection

Locked. You’ve made money safe.

✅ EPIC 4 – Single Source of Truth

Locked. You’ve made intent and system state unambiguous.

🔜 EPIC 2 – Upgrade Continuity (next)

This ensures:
	•	The preview → paid transition is seamless
	•	Nothing “disappears” after checkout
	•	Users understand why the editor changes
	•	The moment after payment feels like progress, not a jump cut

This directly protects:
	•	Conversion confidence
	•	Refund rates
	•	Support load
	•	User trust at the most emotionally sensitive moment

🔒 EPIC 3 – Subscription Lifecycle Safety (after)

This is important, but it protects:
	•	Long-term correctness
	•	Edge cases
	•	Cancellation / downgrade paths
	•	Account drift over time

EPIC 3 matters after users are successfully onboarded into paid usage.

Think of it like this (film analogy)

You’ve:
	•	Secured the box office takings (EPIC 1)
	•	Locked the script everyone agrees on (EPIC 4)

Now you must:
	•	Smooth the cut between Act 1 and Act 2 (EPIC 2)

Only then do you:
	•	Worry about the extended cut, licensing, and distribution windows (EPIC 3)

If Act 1 → Act 2 is jarring, people walk out before the credits.

⸻

What EPIC 2 should guarantee (quick checklist)

As you move into EPIC 2, your north star should be:

After successful checkout, the user should feel:
	•	“Everything I made is still here”
	•	“I understand why the UI changed”
	•	“I know what I can do next”
	•	“This feels intentional and professional”

If EPIC 2 nails that, EPIC 3 becomes a calm, mechanical exercise.

Recommendation (firm)

✅ Proceed with EPIC 2 – Upgrade Continuity

When that’s complete:
	•	You’ll have a psychologically sound upsell funnel
	•	You’ll have protected the most fragile moment in the journey
	•	EPIC 3 can be implemented without pressure or ambiguity

If you want, before you start EPIC 2, I can:
	•	Help you define the exact success criteria
	•	Sanity-check the post-checkout flow
	•	Or help you write the first-entry Professional Editor orientation copy

But directionally:
You’re choosing between feel and plumbing.

Right now, feel wins.

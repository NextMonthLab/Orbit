Absolutely. Here is a single, clean, copy-paste prompt you can give to Replit that is only about the ZIP upload, nothing else.

This prompt assumes:
	•	manifest.json at the root
	•	Engine-generated images
	•	Visual continuity + character + location locking
	•	No image generation happening at upload time (just validation + import)

Replit Prompt: Season Pack ZIP Upload (Canonical Specification)

ROLE
You are extending the Story Engine’s ZIP upload system to support full “Season Pack” imports.

GOAL
A single ZIP upload must be able to define:
- the universe (story world + visual continuity)
- characters (including locked visual profiles)
- locations (with continuity rules)
- cards (daily story units with image-generation metadata)

The ZIP is the canonical source of truth for a season.

--------------------------------
ZIP STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
--------------------------------
The uploaded ZIP must contain at minimum:

/manifest.json

Optional (future-compatible):
/assets/images/   (for reference images later)

--------------------------------
MANIFEST FORMAT (REQUIRED)
--------------------------------

Top-level fields:
- schemaVersion (number)
- season (number or string)
- seasonId (string, stable identifier)
- universe (object)
- characters (array)
- locations (array)
- cards (array)

--------------------------------
UNIVERSE
--------------------------------
manifest.universe must support:

Required:
- name (string)
- description (string)
- visual_mode ("engine_generated" | "author_supplied")

If visual_mode === "engine_generated", the following are REQUIRED:
- visual_style.base_prompt
- visual_style.negative_prompt
- visual_style.aspect_ratio
- visual_continuity.art_direction
- visual_continuity.palette
- visual_continuity.camera_language
- visual_continuity.lighting_rules
- visual_continuity.texture_rules
- visual_continuity.taboo_list (array)

Optional:
- universe.slug
- universe.styleNotes
- visual_style.consistency (character_lock, location_lock, palette_lock)

--------------------------------
CHARACTERS
--------------------------------
Each character must include:

Required:
- id (string, unique, lowercase-safe)
- name (string)
- visual_profile.continuity_description

If visual_mode === "engine_generated", visual_profile is REQUIRED.

visual_profile supports:
- continuity_description (string)
- age_range
- build
- face_features
- hair
- wardrobe
- mannerisms
- do_not_change (array of strings)

--------------------------------
LOCATIONS
--------------------------------
Each location must include:

Required:
- id (string, unique)
- name (string)
- continuity_description (string)

Optional:
- lighting
- textures
- do_not_change (array)

--------------------------------
CARDS
--------------------------------
Each card must include:

Required:
- dayIndex (number, 1-based)
- title (string)
- sceneText (string)
- primary_character_ids (array of character ids)
- status ("draft" | "published")

Optional but supported:
- captions (array of strings)
- recapText (string)
- scene_description (string)
- chat_unlocked_character_ids (array of character ids)
- location_id (string)
- publishAt (ISO date or null)

--------------------------------
IMAGE GENERATION FIELDS
--------------------------------
Cards may include:

image_generation:
- prompt (string)
- negative_prompt (string, optional)
- shot_type (string, optional)
- lighting (string, optional)

RULE:
If image_generation.prompt exists, it is always preferred.
scene_description is only a fallback.

--------------------------------
VALIDATION RULES
--------------------------------
On upload, the system must:

1) Validate schema shape and required fields
2) Ensure all referenced character IDs exist
3) Ensure referenced location IDs exist
4) Enforce visual continuity requirements when visual_mode = engine_generated
5) Fail fast with clear error messages (JSON path + reason)

--------------------------------
IMPORT BEHAVIOUR
--------------------------------
On successful upload:
- Universe, characters, locations, and cards are created
- Cards are imported without generating images
- Cards with image_generation data are marked as "prompt_ready"
- Image generation happens only when triggered explicitly from Admin

--------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
--------------------------------
Implement ZIP upload parsing, validation, and import exactly as specified.
Do not auto-generate images during upload.


⸻

Why this prompt works
	•	It is narrow (ZIP upload only)
	•	It matches your current engine architecture
	•	It avoids premature image generation
	•	It enforces visual continuity as first-class data
	•	It future-proofs creators without overcomplication

If you want next:
	•	I can generate a matching downloadable template ZIP
	•	or a Time Spent example pack using this exact spec
	•	or a CSV → ZIP converter spec for bulk uploads later

Just say the word.

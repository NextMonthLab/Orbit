# REPLIT PROMPT 1 — BUILD THE DEMO ORBITS LAUNCHPAD (PAGES + ROUTES + SHELL)
# Phase 2: Scaffold the public demo page and the demo launch shell (no real demo data yet)

## Goal
Implement the public-facing **Flagship Demo Orbits launchpad** so visitors can:
1) browse curated demo Orbit cards, and
2) click **Launch Demo** to enter a dedicated demo route that bypasses the normal Orbit creation / ingestion UI.

This phase must feel premium and finished, but the demo Orbits themselves can remain placeholders.

## Non-negotiables
- Do NOT touch or refactor the normal Orbit creation / ingestion UI.
- Do NOT implement ingestion.
- Do NOT implement full chat or real datasets.
- This is purely routing + UI scaffolding + placeholder shell.

## Routes to add
Create these routes (match existing router conventions and folder structure):
1) `/orbits/demos`
   - Public demo listing page

2) `/orbit/demo/:demoId`
   - Public demo launch route
   - Loads a placeholder "Demo Orbit Shell" for now

If the app already uses a different naming pattern (singular/plural), align to it, but keep the intent identical.

## Page 1: Demo Orbits Listing
Create a new page/component: `DemoOrbitsPage`

### Requirements
- Hero section:
  - Title: **Flagship Demo Orbits**
  - Subtitle: something like:
    “Explore fully curated demo Orbits that show what your business could feel like with NextMonth.”
  - Primary CTA button: **Launch a Demo**
    - Scrolls to the demo grid or focuses the demo list

- Demo grid:
  - Premium card layout (not admin style)
  - Each card shows:
    - Name
    - Sector tag (Food, Professional Services, Ecommerce, Healthcare, Property)
    - One-line positioning
    - Status badge: Coming Soon (for now)
    - Primary button: **Launch Demo**
    - Secondary link/button: **What can Orbit do?** (link to an existing marketing page if present, otherwise route to `/` for now)

- Filtering (lightweight, optional but ideal):
  - Simple filter chips for the sectors
  - If this is too much for now, skip it, but structure the UI so it can be added later without a redesign.

## Demo list fixture (placeholder data only)
Create a fixture file that powers the listing page. Use the simplest structure now so we can expand later.

Suggested location:
- `client/src/data/demoOrbits.ts` (or wherever your existing app keeps fixtures)

Export an array like:

[
  {
    id: "slice-and-stone",
    name: "Slice & Stone Pizza",
    sector: "Food",
    tagline: "Artisan pizza delivery with obsessive operational transparency.",
    location: "Bristol",
    status: "coming_soon"
  },
  {
    id: "clarity-accountants",
    name: "Clarity Chartered Accountants",
    sector: "Professional Services",
    tagline: "Fixed-fee accountancy with radical transparency on pricing and process.",
    location: "Leeds (UK-wide remote)",
    status: "coming_soon"
  },
  {
    id: "techvault-uk",
    name: "TechVault UK",
    sector: "Ecommerce",
    tagline: "Refurbished tech with grade transparency and buying confidence tools.",
    location: "Manchester (UK-wide delivery)",
    status: "coming_soon"
  },
  {
    id: "fernwood-dental",
    name: "Fernwood Dental Practice",
    sector: "Healthcare",
    tagline: "NHS + private dental care with treatment transparency and booking simplicity.",
    location: "Nottingham",
    status: "coming_soon"
  },
  {
    id: "greenway-lettings",
    name: "Greenway Property Lettings",
    sector: "Property",
    tagline: "Lettings agency with landlord and tenant transparency.",
    location: "Oxford",
    status: "coming_soon"
  }
]

The page must render from this fixture.

## Page 2: Demo Orbit Shell
Create a new page/component: `DemoOrbitShellPage` for route `/orbit/demo/:demoId`

### Behaviour
- Read `demoId` from the route params.
- Look up the demo in `demoOrbits.ts`.
- If not found:
  - Show a friendly "Demo not found" state
  - Provide a button: **Back to Demo Orbits** (routes to `/orbits/demos`)

### Shell UI (premium placeholder)
Display:
- Demo name, sector, location, tagline
- A clear placeholder block that says:
  “This is a curated demo Orbit. The full dataset-backed experience will load here next.”

Include 3 placeholder tiles/buttons (non-functional for now):
- Overview
- Explore Knowledge
- Ask the Orbit (Coming Soon)

And a small note (dev-friendly but user-safe):
- “This demo bypasses Orbit creation and ingestion.”

## Acceptance Criteria (must satisfy)
- `/orbits/demos` exists and renders a premium demo listing grid from the fixture file
- Every card has a **Launch Demo** button that routes to `/orbit/demo/:demoId`
- `/orbit/demo/:demoId` renders the correct placeholder shell based on the fixture lookup
- Unknown demoId shows a friendly not-found state with navigation back
- No changes to ingestion or normal Orbit creation flows
- No large datasets, no chat implementation yet

## Deliverables
After implementation, output:
1) Files created/modified
2) The exact routes added
3) Confirmation that standard Orbit creation/ingestion flow remains unchanged

Right — this is an important catch, and it explains why the experience feels wrong even to you.

This isn’t just a copy or framing issue anymore.
This is a state-leak / routing bug between admin, preview, and public modes.

Let’s break it down cleanly.

⸻

What should have happened vs what did happen

What you expected (correct mental model)

You’re logged in as an admin.

So after generating an Orbit you expect one of these:
	1.	Admin Setup Flow
	•	“Orbit created”
	•	You’re taken into configuration / setup / review
	•	Public preview is optional and clearly marked

OR
	2.	Admin Preview Mode
	•	You see the Orbit as visitors will see it
	•	BUT with admin affordances layered on top
	•	And no claim CTA, no forbidden states

⸻

What actually happened

You were logged in as an admin, but the system:
	•	Dropped you straight into the public unclaimed Orbit view
	•	Showed:
	•	“403 – Forbidden”
	•	“How can I gain access…”
	•	“Claim for free”
	•	Even exposed Deep Scan UI before intent

That means the system misidentified your role/state at render time.

⸻

Root cause (this is the real problem)

You currently have at least three conceptual states, but the UI is treating them as one:
	1.	Public viewer (unclaimed)
	2.	Admin, logged in, but Orbit not yet claimed/activated
	3.	Admin, claimed + active Orbit

Right now:
	•	State 2 is being rendered as State 1
	•	With some admin UI leaking through
	•	And some paid/advanced affordances visible too early

That’s why it feels incoherent.

⸻

The key mistake

You’re using “claimed vs unclaimed” as the primary state check.

But for rendering, the primary check must be:

Who is viewing this Orbit right now?

Not:
	•	“Is this business claimed?”
	•	“Is there data yet?”

But:
	•	Is the viewer the admin?
	•	Is this a public visitor?

Claim status is secondary.

⸻

The correct state hierarchy (lock this in)

This needs to be explicit in code and UI logic:

1. Viewer Role (top-level)
	•	viewer = public | admin

2. Orbit Status (secondary)
	•	orbit = draft | preview | claimed | active

3. Plan Status (gating)
	•	plan = none | orbit_free | orbit_paid

Rendering decisions should always start with viewer role.

⸻

What should happen in your exact scenario

You are:
	•	viewer = admin
	•	orbit = draft / preview
	•	plan = unknown or not yet active

Therefore the UI should:
	•	❌ Never show “403 Forbidden”
	•	❌ Never show “Claim for free” (to the admin)
	•	❌ Never show public-facing “Why am I seeing…” cards

Instead it should show an Admin First-Run State, something like:

Your Orbit has been created

You’re currently viewing it in preview mode.

Next steps:
• Review what we’ve discovered
• Customise appearance
• Activate your Orbit to go live

With buttons like:
	•	“Review extracted data”
	•	“Run advanced scan” (if eligible)
	•	“Activate Orbit”

⸻

Why this happened (likely)

Based on what you’ve described, one or more of these is true:
	1.	The Orbit page is rendered via a public route, even for admins
	2.	Admin identity is known globally, but not passed into the Orbit renderer
	3.	The UI checks:
	•	if (!claimed) → show unclaimed state
	•	instead of:
	•	if (viewer === admin) → admin view
	4.	Claim CTA is being used as a catch-all for “not active yet”

This is very common in early systems — but now you’re at the point where it has to be untangled.

⸻

Immediate fixes (do these before anything else)

1. Hard rule: Admins never see public unclaimed UI

Put this in stone.

If viewer === admin:
	•	Suppress:
	•	403 language
	•	“Why am I seeing…”
	•	“Claim for free”
	•	Replace with:
	•	Admin setup / preview messaging

Even if the Orbit is totally empty.

⸻

2. Split “Preview” from “Public”

Right now Preview = Public + leaks.

You need:
	•	/orbit/:slug → public
	•	/admin/orbit/:slug or admin-flagged render → admin preview

They can look similar, but they are not the same state.

⸻

3. Gate Advanced Scan by plan, not by visibility

That “Refresh Site Data (Deep Scan)” button appearing early is another leak.

Rules:
	•	Visible only when:
	•	viewer = admin
	•	AND orbit is claimed
	•	AND plan allows it

Never show it:
	•	in public view
	•	in draft preview unless explicitly allowed

⸻

Why this matters so much

This isn’t cosmetic.

If you, as the creator, feel:

“Why is my own system telling me I’m forbidden?”

A real business owner will feel:

“This is embarrassing — my customers are seeing an error.”

And they’ll bounce or never claim.

⸻

What I’d do next (in order)
	1.	Fix viewer-role rendering logic
	2.	Introduce an explicit Admin First-Run / Preview state
	3.	Remove all error semantics from public discovery
	4.	Only then revisit copy and conversion polish

⸻

If you want, next step I can:
	•	Help you define the exact state matrix as a table (viewer × orbit × plan → UI)
	•	Or help you write a Replit prompt to refactor routing/render logic cleanly
	•	Or rewrite the Admin First-Run screen copy so it feels calm and intentional

But you were absolutely right to stop and flag this. This was a systems issue, not you being picky.

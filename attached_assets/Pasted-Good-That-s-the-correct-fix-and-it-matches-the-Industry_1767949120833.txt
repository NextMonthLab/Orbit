Good. That’s the correct fix, and it matches the Industry Orbit doctrine: official first, designed fallback second, never stock photos.

A couple of tighten-ups so this stays bulletproof as you scale:

1) Don’t stop at heroImageUrl and logoUrl

Those are fine as “immediate fields”, but make sure you also store provenance so you don’t end up with random hotlinks later:

Minimum extra fields (even if optional):
	•	imageSourceType: OFFICIAL | PRIMARY | SECONDARY | UPLOADED
	•	imageSourceUrl: where you found it (product page / newsroom)
	•	lastVerifiedUtc: so you can refresh if links die

This protects you when manufacturers redesign sites and break URLs.

2) Backfill plan (so Smart Glasses stops looking half-finished)

Right now you’ve made the UI resilient, which is great. Next, make the Orbit look premium fast with a simple backfill rule:

Manufacturers (entities)
	•	Add logoAssetId (or logoUrl) for the top 10 brands first.
	•	If you can only do 5: do Meta, Apple, Google, XREAL, Rokid (or Vuzix depending on your dataset).

Products

During CPAC seed import:
	•	If heroImageUrl provided, store it.
	•	If not, attempt a one-time extraction from canonical product page:
	•	og:image first
	•	else first “hero” image selector
	•	If extraction fails, leave blank and rely on placeholder (that’s fine).

3) Make placeholders feel “brand-tier”, not “random gradient”

Your initials placeholder is the right idea. Two small improvements:
	•	Generate gradient deterministically from the entity/product ID (so Meta always looks like Meta-ish, not changing every refresh).
	•	Use two-letter initials for multi-word brands (e.g., ML for Magic Leap, XR for XREAL if you want it stylised).

4) Ensure the Orbit tiles never show broken image chrome

Even with correct URLs, some will 404.

UI rules:
	•	onError → swap to placeholder immediately (no broken image icon)
	•	lazy-load images
	•	always reserve aspect ratio so tiles don’t jump around

5) One more alignment point

You mentioned:

“Add logoAssetId to manufacturers… Add heroImageUrl to products during CPAC seed import”

Yes, but pick one canonical approach:
	•	Either store asset IDs and serve via your own CDN/proxy
	•	Or store URLs and optionally proxy later

I’d recommend: asset IDs long-term, but allow URL passthrough for now, with a later “asset ingest” job that pulls official images into your own storage.

That’s how you avoid a future “half the Orbit images broke overnight” incident.

⸻

Quick acceptance criteria (so you can be sure it’s done)

On /orbit/smart-glasses:
	•	Every product tile shows either hero image, manufacturer logo, or placeholder (never empty).
	•	No stock imagery ever appears.
	•	Broken image URLs automatically fall back to placeholder.
	•	Brands and products look intentional even with zero images populated.

If Rapplet has already shipped those behaviours, you’re in a very strong place.

Next thing I’d focus on is featured selection (intentTags / heuristics) so the best products surface automatically.

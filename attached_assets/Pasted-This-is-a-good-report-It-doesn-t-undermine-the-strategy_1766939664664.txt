This is a good report. It doesn’t undermine the strategy – it sharpens it. And the conclusion is very clear:

Your model works.
The only thing that can hurt you is unbounded free usage.

So the next logical step is not more pricing debate.
It’s to lock the guardrails so this stays profitable as you scale.

I’ll be decisive and give you numbers you can ship.

⸻

Decision to lock now (recommended)

1. Free Orbit – Conversation Rate Limits (LOCK THIS)

Limit
	•	100 conversation messages per Orbit per month
	•	Reset monthly
	•	Soft limit first, hard limit second

Why 100
	•	Enough to feel genuinely useful
	•	Prevents “power users” from camping on free
	•	Keeps worst-case free cost under ~£1.50–£2/month

UX behaviour
	•	At ~80 messages: subtle notice
“You’re approaching the free conversation limit.”
	•	At 100: polite stop + value framing
“To continue conversations and unlock insights, upgrade your Orbit.”

No error tone. No punishment tone.

This alone neutralises the biggest risk RAP identified.

⸻

2. Orbit Insight – ICE “Fair Usage” (LOCK THIS)

You must define “fair usage” internally, even if you don’t shout it.

Recommended
	•	6 ICEs per month included on Orbit Insight
	•	Soft cap, not a hard stop

UX behaviour
	•	At 6:
“You’ve used most of your included ICEs this month.”
	•	At 8+:
“Create more ICEs with credits, or upgrade to Orbit Intelligence.”

Why this works:
	•	Average Insight user will stay under this
	•	Heavy users self-identify
	•	You don’t suddenly become a “metered SaaS villain”

Cost maths stays healthy.

⸻

3. Orbit Intelligence – No ICE Anxiety

For Orbit Intelligence (£99):
	•	Either:
	•	Higher fair usage (e.g. 12–15 ICEs/month), or
	•	Effectively “unlimited” with abuse monitoring

This tier is:
	•	smaller volume
	•	higher intent
	•	highest margin

Do not annoy them.

⸻

4. ICE Types – Implement RAP’s recommendation

This is important and smart.

Define two ICE types internally (you don’t have to over-market it):
	•	Express ICE
	•	Text + images
	•	Default
	•	~£0.60–£1 cost
	•	Cinematic ICE
	•	Includes video
	•	Higher cost
	•	Limited on bundled tiers

Rules
	•	Express ICEs count as 1
	•	Cinematic ICEs:
	•	Cost 1 credit in Grow
	•	Count as 2 “usage units” in bundled tiers

This protects margin without changing public pricing.

⸻

What this means strategically (big picture)

After these guardrails:
	•	Free tier stops being a liability
	•	Grow tier remains pure upside
	•	Insight tier becomes your revenue engine
	•	Intelligence tier becomes your margin engine
	•	ICE Maker stays highly profitable

And crucially:

You never have to claw features back later.
You set expectations correctly from day one.

⸻

The three guardrails to write into docs/code comments

If you want to codify this, these are the rules to bake in:
	1.	Free Orbit conversations are rate-limited.
	2.	Bundled ICE usage is soft-capped and monitored.
	3.	Video generation is the primary ICE cost driver and must be controlled.

Everything else is optimisation.

⸻

My recommendation for next step

You have two good options now:

Option A (most logical)

👉 Lock the exact rate limits and fair usage numbers
Put them in replit.md as an implementation note.

Option B (product-facing)

👉 Design the UX language for:
	•	free conversation limits
	•	ICE usage nudges
	•	“why upgrade” moments

If you ask me to choose:

Lock the limits first. Then design the UX copy.

Because the copy should respect the limits, not negotiate them.

If you want, next I can:
	•	write the exact in-product messages for hitting limits
	•	or help you decide whether to surface usage counters or keep them invisible

But strategically:
You’re in a very strong position now.

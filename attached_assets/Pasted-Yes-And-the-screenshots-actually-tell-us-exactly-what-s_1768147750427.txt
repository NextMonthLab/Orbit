Yes. And the screenshots actually tell us exactly what’s still wrong.

What’s happening

In the “bad” screenshot, the left side of the caption is chopped off even though you’ve “matched widths”.

That almost always means one of these is still true:
	1.	The bubble width is being set, but padding is making it wider than you think
	•	Default CSS is box-sizing: content-box, which means:
	•	width = innerWidthPx plus left/right padding
	•	So your bubble becomes innerWidthPx + (padding*2) and it spills off-screen and gets clipped.
	2.	The text layer isn’t actually constrained by the bubble (text wrapper width isn’t enforced), so it renders wider and gets clipped by the video frame.

The fact your “good” screenshot works for a shorter sentence but the long one breaks is classic “padding/box-sizing/outerWidth” drift.

The fix (do this, and it stops dead)

✅ Rule: bubble width must be OUTER width, and bubble must be border-box

If your fit engine produces innerWidthPx (usable text width), then:
	•	outerWidthPx = innerWidthPx + (bubblePaddingPx * 2)

And the bubble must have:
	•	boxSizing: 'border-box'

Drop-in pattern (React/Remotion style)

const bubblePaddingPx = 24; // whatever you use
const innerWidthPx = fitGeometry.innerWidthPx; // the exact width you measured against
const outerWidthPx = innerWidthPx + bubblePaddingPx * 2;

return (
  <div
    style={{
      width: outerWidthPx,
      maxWidth: outerWidthPx,
      minWidth: outerWidthPx,
      paddingLeft: bubblePaddingPx,
      paddingRight: bubblePaddingPx,
      boxSizing: "border-box", // <- THIS is the big fix
      marginLeft: "auto",
      marginRight: "auto",
      borderRadius: 24,
      overflow: "visible", // bubble should NOT clip its own text
    }}
  >
    <div
      style={{
        width: innerWidthPx,
        maxWidth: innerWidthPx,
        boxSizing: "border-box",
        whiteSpace: "normal",
        overflowWrap: "anywhere",
        wordBreak: "break-word",
      }}
    >
      {text}
    </div>
  </div>
);

Also do this check (it catches the “text isn’t constrained” bug)

Make sure the text wrapper is not position: absolute, and doesn’t have its own left/right rules fighting the width.

30-second debug to confirm

Temporarily add outlines:

outline: "2px solid lime"   // bubble
outline: "2px solid cyan"   // text wrapper

If the lime box hangs off the left edge in the bad case, it’s 100% the box-sizing/padding outer-width issue.

The punchline

Right now you’ve likely set:
	•	bubble width = innerWidthPx
	•	bubble padding = 24px

…which means your bubble is 48px wider than the fit maths, so it gets clipped.

Fixing border-box + outerWidthPx will make the long sentence behave exactly like the short one.

If you paste the current ScaleToFitCaption bubble + text wrapper styles, I’ll point to the exact property that’s still sabotaging it.

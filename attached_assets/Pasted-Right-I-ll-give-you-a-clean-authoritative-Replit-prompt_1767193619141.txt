Right. I’ll give you a clean, authoritative Replit prompt you can drop straight in. This is written to direct the system, not debate with it.

No ambiguity. No options list. This locks the intent while leaving implementation freedom.

Replit Prompt: Orbit Navigation Restructure (Authoritative)

Context

You are working inside the NextMonth / Orbit product.

Orbit is a public-facing product surface that doubles as:
	•	A discovery layer for visitors
	•	A conversion layer for prospects
	•	A management surface for business owners

The key design principle is:

The public Orbit is the product.
Ownership enhances the view, it does not replace it.

Do not turn Orbit into a traditional “public site + admin panel” split.
Maintain a thin, cinematic boundary between public and private.

⸻

Problem to Solve (Confirmed)

The current Orbit navigation causes confusion due to:
	•	Overlapping concepts (“Dashboard” vs “Business Hub”)
	•	Indirect access to owner tools
	•	No support for managing multiple Orbits
	•	One menu serving owners, non-owners, and guests without adaptation

This restructure is a clarification pass, not a rebuild.

⸻

Required Outcomes (Non-Negotiable)

1. Introduce My Orbits
	•	A first-class navigation item for logged-in owners
	•	Lists all Orbits owned by the user
	•	Shows lightweight stats per Orbit (visits, interactions, etc.)
	•	Primary action: Open Hub
	•	This is the owner’s fastest path to control

2. Remove or Rename “Orbit Dashboard”
	•	The term Dashboard must not be used for discovery or marketing surfaces
	•	Replace with a name that implies exploration, not control (e.g. Orbit Home / Explore Orbit)
	•	“Hub” or equivalent language is reserved for owned management only

3. Role-Adaptive Orbit Menu (Soft, Not Hard Gated)

The Orbit menu must adapt based on user state:

Logged-in Orbit Owner
Orbit menu shows:
	•	My Orbits
	•	Explore Orbits
	•	Knowledge Map (defaults to primary owned Orbit)
	•	Intelligence (defaults to owner context)

Logged-in Non-Owner
Orbit menu shows:
	•	Explore Orbits
	•	Claim an Orbit
	•	How Orbit Works

Guest (Not Logged In)
Orbit menu shows:
	•	Explore Orbits
	•	Claim an Orbit (leads to sign-in → claim flow)
	•	Sign In

Do not expose management actions to non-owners.
Do not fully hide advanced concepts; teaser visibility is acceptable.

⸻

Navigation Behaviour Rules
	•	Owners should never need to visit their public Orbit to access their Hub
	•	Clicking an Orbit anywhere should:
	•	Show subtle “Owner View” affordances if owned
	•	Remain clean and public if not
	•	Public vs private is contextual, not a hard fork

⸻

Naming & Language Rules
	•	“Dashboard” implies control and ownership. Avoid unless literal.
	•	“Hub” = private, owner-only management
	•	“Explore” = public discovery
	•	Language should reinforce ownership enhancement, not mode switching

⸻

Explicit Non-Goals (Do Not Do These)
	•	Do not create a separate “Admin App”
	•	Do not hard-split Orbit into public vs private URLs beyond what already exists
	•	Do not remove discovery from owners
	•	Do not overcomplicate permissions or roles

⸻

Success Criteria

This task is complete when:
	•	Owners can reach their management tools in one click
	•	Non-owners clearly understand how to explore or claim
	•	The Orbit menu no longer mixes discovery, management, and marketing blindly
	•	The product still feels cinematic and singular, not fragmented

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Add microcopy for menu items (very powerful here)
	•	Design the My Orbits screen UX
	•	Or script the owner-context affordances precisely (badges, ribbons, subtle UI cues)

But this prompt alone is enough to move Replit decisively.

Good call trusting your gut on this one. This is the kind of polish that separates “clever” from credible.

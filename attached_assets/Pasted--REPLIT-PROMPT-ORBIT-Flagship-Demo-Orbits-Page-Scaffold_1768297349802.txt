# REPLIT PROMPT — ORBIT: Flagship Demo Orbits Page (Scaffold Only)

## Context
We are going to hardcode several “Flagship Demo Orbits” as showcase experiences on the public site.
These demos will NOT be created through the normal Orbit creation UI. They will be curated/hardcoded and launched directly.

Your task right now is ONLY to scaffold the dedicated demo page + routing + placeholder launch flows.
DO NOT build the demo Orbits themselves yet. Just create the infrastructure that expects them.

## Objectives (Scaffold Only)
1) Create a dedicated public page for demos:
   - Route: `/orbits/demos` (or `/orbit/demos` if that matches existing conventions)
   - Page title: “Demo Orbits” (or “Flagship Demo Orbits”)
   - Short intro copy explaining these are curated showcase Orbits.
   - A strong CTA above the list: “Start a Demo” / “Launch a Demo” / “Explore Demo Orbits”

2) On this page, display a list/grid of demo Orbit “cards” (placeholder data for now).
   Each card must include:
   - Name
   - Industry tag (e.g., Takeaway, Professional Services, Ecommerce)
   - One-line promise (what makes it impressive)
   - Status badge: “Coming Soon” (until wired)
   - Primary button: “Launch Demo”
   - Secondary button/link: “View What You Can Do” (links to pricing/onboarding page if it exists, otherwise placeholder)

3) Clicking “Launch Demo” should route the user straight into a demo Orbit session:
   - Route pattern: `/orbit/demo/:demoId`
   - For now, this route should load a placeholder “Demo Orbit Shell” screen that confirms:
     - demoId
     - “This is a hardcoded flagship demo Orbit. Data will be injected here soon.”
   - NO ingestion logic. NO UI wizard. NO create-orbit flow.
   - This is a clean, direct launch.

4) Add a small “Developer Notes” / “TODO” block (only visible in dev mode if possible):
   - “Demo Orbits are hardcoded and will be added as JSON payloads / fixtures.”
   - “This route bypasses standard Orbit creation UI.”

## Data Structure (Placeholder Fixtures)
Create a simple fixture file for demo listings, e.g.:
- `client/src/data/demoOrbits.ts` (or equivalent)
Export an array like:
[
  {
    id: "pizza-01",
    name: "Banbury Pizza Co.",
    industry: "Takeaway",
    tagline: "A menu you can talk to: delivery, allergens, offers, the lot.",
    status: "coming_soon"
  },
  {
    id: "accountancy-01",
    name: "Summit Accountants",
    industry: "Professional Services",
    tagline: "Services, onboarding, pricing, timelines – instantly clear.",
    status: "coming_soon"
  },
  {
    id: "techshop-01",
    name: "Northside Tech",
    industry: "Ecommerce",
    tagline: "Compare devices, warranties, returns, delivery, finance – properly.",
    status: "coming_soon"
  }
]

The UI should render from this fixture so we can swap “coming_soon” to “live” later.

## UI Requirements
- Keep styling consistent with the current Orbit brand and design system.
- Ensure it looks premium, not like an admin screen:
  - Hero header (title + subtitle + CTA)
  - Card grid with clear buttons
- Buttons should be clearly labelled:
  - Primary: “Launch Demo”
  - Alternative acceptable copy: “Start Demo”, “Explore Demo”, “Enter Demo Orbit”

## Technical Requirements
- Add routes to the existing router (React Router etc.)
- Add two new pages/components:
  - `DemoOrbitsPage` for `/orbits/demos`
  - `DemoOrbitShellPage` for `/orbit/demo/:demoId`
- Use the fixture array for listing and for resolving `demoId` in the shell page.
- If demoId not found, show a friendly 404 state with a button back to `/orbits/demos`.

## Non-Goals (Do Not Do Yet)
- Do not implement Orbit ingestion.
- Do not implement the full Orbit chat experience for demos.
- Do not implement the real demo datasets.
- Do not add pricing logic or authentication gating unless already present.

## Deliverables
- Routes added
- Pages created
- Fixture file created
- Buttons launch into the shell route
- Clean placeholder copy indicating hardcoded demos are coming next

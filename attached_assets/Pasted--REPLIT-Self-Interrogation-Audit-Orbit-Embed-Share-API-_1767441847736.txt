# REPLIT: Self-Interrogation Audit — Orbit Embed/Share + API Connector (Initial Assessment)

You must interrogate the actual codebase and return an evidence-based assessment.
No speculation. No “we could/should”. Use file paths, route paths, schema references, and quick smoke-test instructions.
If something is only UI or only a stub, label it clearly as STUB/MOCK/PARTIAL.

## Audit Targets
A) Orbit “Share / Embed code” feature
B) Orbit “Connect API” / operational insights feature

---

# A) Orbit Share / Embed Code — Evidence Check

1) UI Entry Points
- Where in the UI can a user generate an Orbit share link and/or embed code?
- Provide:
  - route(s)
  - component file path(s)

2) Public Orbit Access
- Is there a public Orbit page route (unauthenticated)?
  - e.g. /o/:slug, /orbit/public/:slug, /embed/orbit/:slug, etc
- Provide:
  - route definition (client + server if relevant)
  - what it renders
  - whether it requires auth

3) Embed Code Generation
- Does embed code exist as a real generated snippet?
- Provide:
  - where the snippet is composed (frontend or backend)
  - exact code snippet template
  - how it injects slug/id + base URL + options
- Confirm whether it uses:
  - iframe embed
  - script widget
  - both

4) Tracking From Embed/Public Views
- When someone views an embedded Orbit, are sessions/events recorded?
- Provide:
  - event tracking endpoint(s)
  - file path(s) where the embed/public page fires events

5) Quick Smoke Test Steps
- Provide a 5-minute test:
  - where to paste the embed code (simple HTML page route, test page, etc)
  - what network calls should appear
  - what DB tables/rows should change

Output for A:
- Status: ✅ REAL / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ MISSING
- Evidence: file paths + routes + schema/tables used
- Missing pieces (if any): bullet list

---

# B) “Connect API to Orbit” — Evidence Check

1) Schema / Storage
- Search for any tables or models related to integrations/data sources:
  - orbit_integrations, data_sources, api_connections, webhooks, credentials, sync_logs, etc
- Provide:
  - schema file path and exact definitions (table + key fields)

2) UI
- Is there a UI screen to connect an API?
- Provide:
  - route(s)
  - component file path(s)
- Confirm if it supports:
  - generic REST (polling)
  - webhook ingestion
  - provider-specific integrations (Shopify/Stripe/etc)

3) Backend Endpoints
- Search for routes such as:
  - POST /api/orbit/:slug/integrations
  - POST /api/orbit/:slug/webhook/...
  - POST /api/orbit/:slug/connect-api
  - scheduled polling jobs
- Provide:
  - server route handler file paths
  - what they store
  - auth method (token, bearer, etc)

4) Operational Insights Wiring
- Does any integration data affect insights generation?
- Provide:
  - where insight generator reads integration/operational data
  - file path(s) and the query used
- If not wired, say so.

5) Quick Smoke Test Steps
- Provide a 5-minute test:
  - how to create a connection (or why you cannot)
  - how to POST a sample payload (webhook) or trigger polling
  - what DB tables/rows should change
  - whether any insight changes as a result

Output for B:
- Status: ✅ REAL / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ MISSING
- Evidence: file paths + routes + schema/tables used
- Missing pieces (if any): bullet list

# Codebase Search Instructions (Required)
Perform a code search for the following keywords and report findings with file paths:
- embed, iframe, script, widget, share, public orbit, copy code, snippet
- integration, connector, webhook, apiKey, credentials, data source, sync, provider
- orbit_integrations, api_connections, data_sources, webhook_events

---

# Final Output Format (Required)
Return:

1) Summary table:
Feature | Status | Evidence highlights (paths/routes/tables)

2) Detailed findings:
- A) Embed/Share
- B) API Connector

3) Punch list:
If anything is missing, list the smallest next steps to reach a safe MVP.

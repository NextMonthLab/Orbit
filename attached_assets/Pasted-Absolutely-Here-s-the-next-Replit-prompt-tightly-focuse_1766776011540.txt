Absolutely. Here’s the next Replit prompt, tightly focused on messaging + onboarding, and written to sharpen clarity without fragmenting the product.

This prompt assumes one engine, three lenses.

You can paste this straight into Replit.

🔹 REPLIT PROMPT: NextScene Messaging & Onboarding Refinement (Three Sectors)

Product

NextScene

Objective

Tighten messaging, onboarding, and first-use experience so that:
	•	Different audiences instantly feel “this is for me”
	•	The underlying engine remains unified
	•	Onboarding adapts by lens, not by product fork

This is about framing and flow, not new core features.

⸻

1. Core Principle (Do Not Break This)

NextScene is one engine with three onboarding lenses:
	1.	Brand & Business
	2.	Creators & Filmmakers
	3.	Knowledge & Learning

The system, UI, and data model stay the same.
Only:
	•	Language
	•	Defaults
	•	Examples
	•	Guardrail strictness
change per lens.

⸻

2. Entry Point: Sector Selection (Lightweight)

After clicking “Create a NextScene”, users see a simple choice screen:

What are you creating today?

Options (with microcopy)

A. Brand / Business Story

Turn a website or product into an interactive experience

B. Creative Story / Script

Bring a story, script, or idea to life moment by moment

C. Knowledge / Learning

Transform documents into something people actually remember

This choice:
	•	Sets onboarding copy
	•	Preselects templates
	•	Adjusts guardrails
	•	Never locks the user permanently

Users can switch later.

⸻

3. Messaging Tightening by Sector

A. Brand & Business Lens

Primary emotional hook:

“Explain what you do without making people read.”

Language rules:
	•	Emphasise clarity, trust, conversion
	•	Avoid “storytelling fluff”
	•	Avoid “AI marketing” phrasing

Replace generic copy with:
	•	“Your website → a cinematic walkthrough”
	•	“Let customers explore, then ask questions”
	•	“Every answer stays grounded in your actual content”

Onboarding defaults:
	•	URL input first
	•	Character preset: Brand Expert
	•	Guardrails: strict factual boundaries ON
	•	Visuals: illustrative, brand-aligned
	•	Export options highlighted early

⸻

B. Creators & Filmmakers Lens

Primary emotional hook:

“Let people live inside your story.”

Language rules:
	•	Lean cinematic, emotional, intimate
	•	Avoid business or productivity language
	•	Avoid “content” framing

Replace generic copy with:
	•	“Each card is a moment”
	•	“Scenes, beats, or memories”
	•	“Your audience doesn’t just watch, they respond”

Onboarding defaults:
	•	Script / text upload first
	•	Character creation surfaced early
	•	Guardrails: creative freedom bias
	•	Visuals: character-driven
	•	Daily release vs full-drop option introduced

⸻

C. Knowledge & Learning Lens

Primary emotional hook:

“Turn information into understanding.”

Language rules:
	•	Calm, reassuring, intelligent
	•	Avoid hype
	•	Avoid entertainment framing

Replace generic copy with:
	•	“Make dense material digestible”
	•	“Explain once, let it scale”
	•	“Ask the expert without interrupting them”

Onboarding defaults:
	•	PDF / document upload first
	•	Character preset: Subject Matter Expert
	•	Guardrails: accuracy-first
	•	Visuals: explanatory, diagram-friendly
	•	Completion tracking surfaced

⸻

4. First-Time Onboarding Flow (All Lenses)

Each onboarding flow should follow this same structure, with different copy:
	1.	What you upload
Short reassurance about what will happen
	2.	What NextScene extracts
Themes, boundaries, tone (visualised simply)
	3.	What you can edit
Prompts, guardrails, visuals are always editable
	4.	What the audience experiences
Cards → interaction → chat → share/export

This builds trust before magic.

⸻

5. Guardrails Messaging (Critical)

Add a visible but calm reassurance across all sectors:

“NextScene doesn’t invent meaning.
It elevates what’s already there.”

In the admin:
	•	Prompts
	•	Negative prompts
	•	Guardrails
must be clearly labeled as creator-controlled, not hidden.

⸻

6. Onboarding Success Criteria

You’ve succeeded if:
	•	A business user never sees “script” language
	•	A filmmaker never sees “conversion” language
	•	A learning user never sees “entertainment” language
	•	All three still end up creating the same underlying object: a NextScene

⸻

7. Explicit Non-Goals (Do Not Add)
	•	No separate products
	•	No separate dashboards
	•	No duplicated code paths
	•	No industry-specific hard forks

This is one engine, three doors.

⸻

8. Output Request

Please:
	1.	Refine homepage messaging to cleanly support this structure
	2.	Implement the sector-selection onboarding step
	3.	Adjust onboarding copy, defaults, and examples per lens
	4.	Keep all functionality shared under the hood

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Script the exact onboarding microcopy screen by screen
	•	Design the visual “engine working” animation
	•	Or pressure-test the first 60 seconds for each sector

You’re not building three products.
You’re teaching three audiences how to see the same one.

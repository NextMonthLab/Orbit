Yes. You’re absolutely right to be concerned, and your instinct here is spot on.

What you’re describing is a core creative failure mode of AI storytelling systems:
they default to interpretation when you actually need faithful cinematic translation.

Right now, IceMaker is behaving like a theme summariser, not a script realiser.

That’s unacceptable for something like Failsafe.

Let’s do this properly.

⸻

First: Name the real problem (so Replit can’t dodge it)

The AI is currently answering the question:

“What is this about?”

When it should be answering:

“How do I stage, pace, and visualise this exact story without changing it?”

That means the issue is upstream of visuals.
It’s in the story-construction prompt and logic layer.

So yes, we absolutely can and should interrogate Replit.

But we need to ask the right questions.

⸻

What we need to extract from Replit (explicitly)

We are not asking them to “improve the story”.

We are asking them to expose the machinery.

Specifically:
	1.	What prompt is used once raw content is ingested?
	2.	Is the model instructed to summarise, reinterpret, or adapt?
	3.	Does it collapse scripts into themes before story construction?
	4.	Is there any abstraction step that loses structure, dialogue, or beats?
	5.	Is there a difference between script input vs article input?
	6.	Where does deviation become allowed or encouraged?

⸻

The exact prompt to give Replit (copy/paste)

This is written deliberately firm, technical, and non-optional.

You’re not asking for ideas.
You’re asking for truth.

🔴 Replit Interrogation Prompt: IceMaker Story Formation

We need a clear technical explanation of how IceMaker currently converts uploaded content (scripts, documents, webpages) into a “story” before visuals are generated.

Please answer the following precisely and concretely, not conceptually:
	1.	What is the exact prompt (or prompt chain) used after content ingestion to form the story output?
	•	If there are multiple stages, list each stage and its purpose.
	2.	Is the model instructed to summarise, reinterpret, adapt, or creatively reframe the input?
	•	If yes, where and why?
	3.	How are scripts handled differently from articles or webpages (if at all)?
	•	Are dialogue, scene headings, action lines, and beats preserved or collapsed?
	4.	At what point does the system extract “themes” or “meaning”?
	•	Is this used as a replacement for structure, or as an enhancement?
	5.	Is there any instruction that allows the AI to deviate from the source material?
	•	If so, what safeguards exist to prevent loss of authorial intent?
	6.	Does the current system treat uploaded scripts as canonical source material, or as inspiration?
	7.	Where exactly would we intervene if we wanted the AI to strictly preserve narrative structure, scene order, character intent, and dialogue?

We are diagnosing a case where a filmmaker uploaded their own script and the resulting experience reflected high-level themes but did not faithfully follow the original story.
This behaviour is not acceptable for script-based projects and must be addressed at the prompt and logic level.

Why this matters (and why you’re right to stop here)

For Failsafe, the AI must behave like:

🎬 a director and production designer

Not:

📝 a book report writer

Your script already is the story.

IceMaker’s job is to:
	•	preserve structure
	•	respect beats
	•	honour character intent
	•	translate scenes into cinematic cards
	•	add interaction without rewriting

If it can’t do that, it’s not a story engine yet. It’s a content blender.

⸻

What comes next (once Replit answers)

Once we see their current prompt/flow, the next step will be:
	•	introducing Story Fidelity Modes, for example:
	•	Faithful Adaptation (Script-Exact)
	•	Interpretive Expansion
	•	Conceptual Summary

Failsafe clearly requires Script-Exact Mode.

But we don’t jump there yet.
First we force clarity.

⸻

You’re doing the right thing by pausing and interrogating the system before polishing visuals.
That’s the difference between a filmmaker building a platform and a tool chasing vibes.

Send that prompt to Replit.
When they reply, bring it back here and we’ll dissect it like a screenplay draft.

This is the moment IceMaker grows up.

We have a regression: tile click opens a centre modal/dialog (blocking overlay). This is NOT the intended “Smart Window”.

INTENDED BEHAVIOUR (already agreed):
- Clicking a tile opens a RIGHT-HAND docked Smart Window (side panel).
- The Orbit canvas/tiles shift left or resize to make space.
- The Smart Window can render richer content including: source material in an iframe, comparison tables, etc.
- This is desktop behaviour. Mobile can use a modal/drawer if needed.

STRICT INSTRUCTION:
Do NOT design or invent a new Smart Window. Investigate why the existing code path is using a Dialog/Modal and restore/reconnect the intended side-panel behaviour.

INVESTIGATION STEPS (report findings, don’t guess):
1) Identify the exact component being used for the current popup
   - Is it shadcn Dialog? Radix Dialog? Something else?
   - Point to the file(s) and component name(s).

2) Trace the click -> state -> render path
   - Where is selectedTopic/activeNode set?
   - Where is the popup rendered?
   - Is there a desktop conditional that routes to Dialog?

3) Search the repo for the intended panel components
   - Look for components named: RightPanel, Inspector, DetailsPane, SmartWindow, SidePanel, Sheet, Drawer, Panel, SplitView, ResizablePanelGroup.
   - If found, report their paths and whether they’re currently unused.

4) If the panel code existed before the Orbit/IceMaker split:
   - Check git history / previous commit / other branch / old repo snapshot for the Smart Window implementation.
   - Identify what files didn’t make it across and why.

5) Fix by RESTORING the correct behaviour
   - Replace the Dialog usage with the docked right panel (desktop).
   - Ensure layout uses a split container (flex/grid) so orbit area resizes left.
   - Keep mobile fallback if needed, but desktop must dock right.

DELIVERABLE:
- Root cause summary (1–2 bullets).
- List the exact files changed.
- Confirm: on desktop, click tile -> docked right panel, orbit shifts left, no blocking overlay.

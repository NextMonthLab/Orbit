Yes – Replit can do this for you, and it’s the right choice to use 99% off rather than 100%.

I’ll be very clear about what Replit can do, what Stripe must do, and what to sanity-check so nothing undermines your EPIC 1 work.

⸻

Short answer
	•	✅ Stripe must create the 99% coupon / promo code
	•	✅ Replit can fully support it in checkout, validation, and webhooks
	•	❌ Replit should not invent discounts or bypass Stripe

Replit’s job is to honour Stripe’s discounted totals, not calculate them.

⸻

The correct division of responsibility (important)

Stripe is responsible for:
	•	Coupon definition (99% off)
	•	Discount application
	•	Final amount calculation
	•	Invoice / payment intent totals

Replit is responsible for:
	•	Using the correct price ID
	•	Passing the promo code to Stripe Checkout
	•	Validating that:
	•	The price ID is expected
	•	The final amount matches Stripe’s discounted amount
	•	Processing the webhook result

If Replit tries to “do” the discount itself, that’s a bug.

⸻

What to ask Replit to do (copy this verbatim)

Paste this into Replit so it doesn’t overthink or block you:

Stripe Discount Support – 99% Off

We will be using a 99% off Stripe promotion code for internal testing.

Requirements:
	•	Checkout must accept Stripe promotion codes normally
	•	Server-side validation must:
	•	Validate the original price ID
	•	Accept the final discounted amount returned by Stripe
	•	Do not reject low or near-zero totals if they result from a valid Stripe coupon

Stripe remains the source of truth for discount calculations.
Replit must not recalculate or override totals.

This is required for realistic payment testing without bypassing revenue protection.

That keeps EPIC 1 intact.

⸻

Why 99% off is the right choice (you chose well)

99% off means:
	•	✔ Card is still required
	•	✔ Payment intent still exists
	•	✔ VAT, rounding, currency logic still runs
	•	✔ Webhooks behave like a real payment
	•	✔ No “£0 edge case” bugs

100% off often skips important paths.

So this is the professional testing setup.

⸻

One thing to double-check in your backend

Make sure your validation logic is not doing this:

❌ if (amount < MIN_PRICE) reject

Instead it should be:

✅

“Does the Stripe amount match the expected price after applying discounts?”

Given what you described earlier, you’re probably already good here, but this is where 99% coupons usually fail if they’re going to.

⸻

Recommended Stripe setup (quick)

In Stripe Dashboard:
	•	Coupon:
	•	99% off
	•	Duration: once
	•	Promotion Code:
	•	Something like DEV99
	•	Restricted to specific price IDs
	•	Limited redemptions

Then test end-to-end through Replit.

⸻

Bottom line

✅ Yes, Replit can support 99% off
✅ Stripe should own the discount
✅ Your revenue protection stays intact
✅ You get realistic payment testing

This is exactly how a production SaaS team does it.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Sanity-check your webhook logic for discounted payments
	•	Or decide how promo codes should behave with subscriptions vs one-offs

But you’re on solid ground here.

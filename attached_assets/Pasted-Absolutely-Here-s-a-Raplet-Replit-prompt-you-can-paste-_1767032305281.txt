Absolutely. Here’s a Raplet (Replit) prompt you can paste straight in. It instructs Replit to create a new dedicated authority page, wire it into your existing navigation (Brands & Businesses / Educators / Creators), add strong CTAs to claim an Orbit, and keep it consistent with your current site patterns.

# RAPLET PROMPT: New Authority Page – “AI Discovery Control” (Orbit)

## Role
You are a senior full-stack product engineer and UX copy integrator working inside the existing NextMonth codebase.
You will NOT rebuild the site. You will add a new dedicated page, route, navigation entry, and UI components using existing patterns.

## Goal
Create a new dedicated authority page that becomes the definitive explanation of:
- The shift from Google indexing to AI-driven discovery (ChatGPT, Gemini and AI answers)
- Why businesses need control over how AI represents them
- Why Orbit is the Business-to-AI interface
- Why claiming an Orbit matters (ownership framing, no fearmongering)
- Introduce the future concept of “Orbit Signal Schema” carefully (no overpromising)

This page must be high quality and conversion-focused, but calm and credible.

## Page Requirements

### 1) Route + URL
Add a new page at:
- `/ai-discovery-control` (primary)
Optionally also add a redirect:
- `/ai-discovery` → `/ai-discovery-control`

### 2) Navigation
Currently we have three sections:
- Brands & Businesses (Orbit lives here)
- Educators
- Creators

Add a new nav entry that is visible under Brands & Businesses AND also appears as a top-level “Pillar” link if the nav supports it.

Nav label:
- “AI Discovery Control” (preferred)
Alternative acceptable:
- “AI Discovery”

### 3) Page Layout
Use the site’s existing layout components and design system.
The page should feel premium, scannable, and authoritative.

Include these blocks in order:
1. Hero section (H1 + lead paragraph + primary CTA)
2. “The shift” section
3. “AI infers your business” section
4. “From SEO to AI representation” section including a simple comparison table
5. “Orbit is how your business speaks to AI” section
6. “Control requires ownership” section + Claim CTA
7. “Beyond interfaces” section introducing the Signal Schema concept (careful language)
8. Closing CTA band

### 4) CTAs (Conversion)
Primary CTA button (hero + bottom):
- “Claim your business Orbit”

This should link to the existing claim flow if it exists (use the canonical claim URL/route used elsewhere).
If claim flow requires a domain:
- send the user to the claim start screen and prefill with current domain if available

Secondary CTA (hero):
- “See Orbit in action” (link to existing Orbit demo page or the Orbit area within Brands & Businesses)

Add microcopy beneath the primary CTA (soft FOMO, no scare tactics):
- “Claiming your Orbit helps control how AI represents your business.”

### 5) Copy to Use (FINAL)
Use this copy exactly (minor punctuation tweaks allowed to match styling). Do not shorten unless necessary.

H1:
“When AI answers questions about your business, who decides what it says?”

Intro:
“For years, businesses focused on being found.
Search rankings. Keywords. Click-through rates.
But discovery has changed.
Today, people don’t search for businesses the way they used to. They ask AI. And AI doesn’t return a list of links. It returns an answer.
A summary. An interpretation. An opinion.
The question is no longer where does my website rank?
It’s this: How is my business being understood and described by AI?”

SECTION: Search has changed. Discovery has changed. Control hasn’t caught up.
“AI-powered systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and AI-enhanced search results are now a primary way people discover and evaluate businesses.
Instead of scanning websites, users ask questions like:
- Who should I trust for this?
- What does this company actually do?
- Are they credible?
- Who’s best for my situation?
The AI answers by interpreting information pulled from across the web.
Not just your website. Not just your marketing copy. But fragments, summaries, assumptions, and third-party references.
And once that answer is given, it often becomes the truth for that user.”

SECTION: AI doesn’t know your business. It infers it.
“This is the uncomfortable reality.
AI systems are not malicious. They’re not biased against you.
But they are interpretive.
They compress nuance. They flatten differentiation. They prioritise what’s easy to summarise, not what matters most.
That means:
- Your positioning can be diluted
- Your proof points can disappear
- Your tone can become generic
- Outdated or partial information can persist
- Context can be guessed instead of known
Most businesses are already being described by AI.
They’re just not part of the conversation.”

SECTION: From SEO to AI representation
“Traditional SEO was about visibility.
AI discovery is about understanding.
This isn’t SEO 2.0.
It’s a shift from optimising for algorithms to defining how your business is represented when AI speaks on your behalf.
The next phase of discovery isn’t about being found.
It’s about being represented accurately.”

Comparison table:
Then | Now
Rankings | Interpretation
Keywords | Meaning
Traffic | Trust
Clicks | Answers
Search engines | AI systems

SECTION: Businesses need a source of truth for AI
“Right now, AI systems are forced to guess.
They scrape. They summarise. They infer.
What’s missing is an authoritative, structured, business-owned source of truth designed for AI.
That’s the gap Orbit exists to fill.”

SECTION: Orbit is how your business speaks to AI
“Orbit is not a chatbot. It’s not a website builder. It’s not an SEO tool.
Orbit is a Business-to-AI interface.
It gives AI systems something better than inference: a clear, structured, up-to-date representation of your business that you control.
With Orbit, you define:
- Who you are and who you’re for
- What you do (and what you don’t)
- How your services should be described
- Which proof points matter
- Which answers are authoritative
- Which information is outdated or sensitive
Orbit doesn’t try to game AI systems.
It gives them something reliable to listen to.”

SECTION: Control requires ownership
“Orbit instances exist for real businesses and domains.
But ownership matters.
Claiming your Orbit:
- Verifies you as the legitimate business owner
- Gives you control over how your business is described
- Allows you to correct, refine, and guide AI understanding
- Unlocks future AI-facing capabilities as discovery evolves
If AI is going to describe your business, it should be using something you own.”

SECTION: Beyond interfaces: the future of AI discovery
“Orbit isn’t just about what humans see.
We’re building toward a future where Orbit also acts as a machine-readable signal designed specifically for AI systems.
A clear, authoritative dataset that AI can read, trust, reference, and query.
Think of it like a lighthouse.
The clearer the signal, the further and more accurately it travels.
As AI discovery continues to evolve, Orbit is designed to become the place AI systems look first to understand a business properly.
Not because they’re forced to.
But because it’s the most reliable source available.”

Closing:
“AI is already shaping how businesses are discovered, evaluated, and recommended.
The question isn’t whether this shift will continue.
It’s whether businesses will accept being interpreted by default, or take control of how they’re understood.
Orbit exists for businesses that choose the second option.”

Final CTA:
“Claim your business Orbit”

### 6) SEO + Metadata
Add metadata:
- title: “AI Discovery Control | NextMonth Orbit”
- description: “Orbit helps businesses control how they are understood and represented in AI-powered discovery, search, and assistants.”

Add OpenGraph/Twitter tags if the system supports it.

### 7) Analytics
If the project has analytics hooks, track:
- page view: ai_discovery_control_view
- claim CTA click: ai_discovery_control_claim_click
- secondary CTA click: ai_discovery_control_demo_click

### 8) Done Criteria
- New page loads at /ai-discovery-control
- New nav link appears correctly
- CTAs work and route correctly
- Styling matches existing site
- Copy is readable on mobile, tablet, desktop
- No duplicate headings, no all caps headings, and no repeated CTA blocks

Proceed to implement now using existing patterns. Do not redesign the whole site.

If you want, I can also give you a second Raplet prompt that builds the Orbit Signal Schema v0.1 spec + endpoint plan (even if you don’t implement it yet), so you’ve got the roadmap sitting next to the new authority page.

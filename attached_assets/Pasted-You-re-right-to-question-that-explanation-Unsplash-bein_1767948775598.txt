You’re right to question that explanation. Unsplash being discontinued is irrelevant to whether the Smart Glasses Orbit should show images.

That answer is basically a red herring.

Here’s the straight truth and the fix.

⸻

The real reason images aren’t showing

Right now, your Orbit is image-agnostic by default. It was previously leaning on a generic image provider (Unsplash) as a convenience fallback. When that went away, nothing replaced it.

But for industry Orbits, especially hardware categories, images should never come from stock photography anyway.

Smart glasses must use:
	•	Official product images
	•	Official brand imagery
	•	Verified press images (secondary fallback)

So your instinct is exactly right.

⸻

What should be happening instead (CPAC-correct)

Images should be treated as first-class CPAC assets, not UI decorations.

Canonical image priority order

For products and manufacturers, the Orbit should resolve images in this order:
	1.	Official manufacturer product images
	•	Product pages
	•	Press kits / newsroom media
	2.	Official brand assets
	•	Logos (SVG/PNG)
	•	Lifestyle shots
	3.	Reputable secondary press images
	•	Verge, Road to VR, UploadVR (only if licensed/embeddable)
	4.	No image (clean placeholder)
	•	Never stock filler for hardware

If none exist → show a designed placeholder, not random imagery.

⸻

What’s missing in your current system

From everything you’ve shared, the blocker is not availability, it’s wiring.

You already have:
	•	canonical_url for products and manufacturers
	•	Pulse sources pointing at official pages
	•	Product specs and entities resolved cleanly

What’s missing is:
	•	mediaRefs / imageRefs actually being populated
	•	A resolver that pulls images from official URLs
	•	The Orbit UI knowing where to look

⸻

The correct fix (no Unsplash, no hacks)

1. Extend the CPAC model properly (if not already)

You want this shape on products and entities:

mediaRefs: {
  primaryImage: {
    url: "https://www.xreal.com/assets/air-2.png",
    source: "official",
    sourceUrl: "https://www.xreal.com/air-2",
    license: "manufacturer"
  },
  gallery: [
    { "url": "...", "type": "product" },
    { "url": "...", "type": "lifestyle" }
  ],
  logo: {
    url: "https://www.meta.com/logo.svg"
  }
}

No AI. No scraping magic. Just stored references.

⸻

2. Populate images during seed import

When importing a product:
	•	If mediaRefs are provided → use them
	•	Else:
	•	Attempt one-time fetch from canonical product page
	•	Extract:
	•	og:image
	•	<img> with product hero markers
	•	Store URL, don’t hotlink blindly

This happens once at import time, not on every page load.

⸻

3. Update Orbit tile rendering logic

Every floating tile should follow this rule:

If mediaRefs.primaryImage exists → show it
Else if manufacturer.logo exists → show logo
Else → show designed placeholder (icon + initials)

Never:
	•	fall back to stock photography
	•	show unrelated lifestyle shots
	•	leave a broken image frame

⸻

What users expect to see (and why they’re right)

When someone opens Smart Glasses, they expect to instantly recognise products.

For example, these are the kinds of images that should appear:

Those aren’t “nice to have”.
They are table stakes for credibility.

⸻

Why Unsplash should never come back

Using Unsplash (or any stock library) for hardware:
	•	Breaks trust
	•	Confuses users
	•	Undermines sponsors and manufacturers
	•	Makes the Orbit feel fake

If there’s no official image yet, it’s better to show none than the wrong one.

⸻

The instruction you should give Replit (copy/paste)

Use this verbatim if you want:

The Smart Glasses Orbit must not rely on Unsplash or stock imagery.

Product and brand images should come from official manufacturer sources and be stored as mediaRefs in CPAC.

During seed import, populate mediaRefs from provided data or extract from canonical product pages (og:image / hero images).

Orbit tiles should resolve images in this order: product image → manufacturer logo → designed placeholder.

If no official image exists, show a placeholder. Do not use stock photography.

⸻

Bottom line

You weren’t wrong.
The Unsplash explanation was a symptom, not a cause.

This Orbit is now strong enough that image integrity matters. Fixing this properly will instantly make Smart Glasses feel real, premium, and sponsor-ready.

If you want, next we can:
	•	define a designed placeholder system so “no image” still looks intentional
	•	or create a one-time backfill plan to populate images for your existing 9 products

Just say the word.

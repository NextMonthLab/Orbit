ROLE
You are a senior full-stack engineer doing a careful product split. You must delete IceMaker from this codebase while preserving Orbit 100% (including build, auth, DB, shared UI, and deployment readiness).

CONTEXT
This repository is now the dedicated Orbit repo and will be imported into a dedicated Replit project.
The codebase previously contained multiple products (Orbit + IceMaker). We must remove IceMaker completely from this repo.

PRIMARY GOAL
Remove all IceMaker-specific code, routes, pages, APIs, UI, prompts, assets, docs, config, and menu items — without breaking Orbit.

CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
1) Do NOT remove any shared dependencies, utilities, or infrastructure unless you can prove they are only used by IceMaker and not used by Orbit.
2) Do NOT break builds. After changes: Typecheck, lint, build, and start must pass.
3) Do NOT change Orbit behaviour except to remove IceMaker links/entry points.
4) If something is shared (auth, db, common UI kit, API client, telemetry, env loader), keep it.
5) Remove IceMaker by boundaries (routes/modules/features), not by random file deletions.

SCOPE: WHAT MUST GO
- IceMaker pages/routes (e.g. /icemaker, /ice, /ice-maker etc.)
- IceMaker UI components, feature modules, hooks, state slices
- IceMaker API endpoints, controllers, services, prompts
- IceMaker navigation items, CTAs, homepage tiles, marketing copy, docs
- IceMaker assets (images/video presets, demo files) only used for IceMaker
- IceMaker env vars ONLY if not used elsewhere
- Any “product switcher” code that references IceMaker

SCOPE: WHAT MUST STAY
- Orbit pages/routes and all Orbit functionality
- Shared layout, shared design system, shared API layer
- Authentication, billing (if used), analytics (if used by Orbit), core middleware
- DB schema used by Orbit
- Deployment/build scripts and runtime start scripts

PROCESS (FOLLOW IN THIS ORDER)
1) Map current product boundaries:
   - List all IceMaker entry points: routes, nav links, API endpoints, feature folders.
   - Identify any shared modules referenced by both products.
2) Remove IceMaker from UI surface:
   - Remove nav links, homepage tiles, product cards, CTAs.
   - Ensure no dead links remain.
3) Remove IceMaker routes/pages:
   - Delete pages/components specific to IceMaker.
   - Remove route registrations and imports.
4) Remove IceMaker backend/API:
   - Delete endpoints/services only used by IceMaker.
   - Remove them from router/index registration.
5) Clean up shared code:
   - Remove unused exports, dead imports, unused env vars.
   - If uncertain, keep it.
6) Run correctness checks:
   - `npm run typecheck` (or equivalent)
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm run start` / `npm run dev`
   - Fix any failures properly (no hacks).

DELIVERABLES
A) A concise “What I removed” list (grouped: routes/pages, api, components, assets, env).
B) A concise “What I kept as shared” list (and why).
C) Confirmation of commands run + results.
D) No references to IceMaker remain in Orbit UI or routing.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Orbit runs locally in Replit without errors.
- All tests/build checks pass (or if no tests exist, build+start passes).
- Searching the repo for “IceMaker”, “icemaker”, “ICE Maker”, “/ice” returns no product references except historical changelog if explicitly kept.
- No broken imports, no dead routes.

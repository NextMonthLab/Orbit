Perfect screenshot. This actually makes the answer much clearer.

Your instinct is right: this screen must stay clean, calm, and IceMaker-first. If you pollute this with Orbit concepts, you’ll break the magic.

So the answer is not “put Orbit here”.

The answer is: protect this screen at all costs, and branch out of it deliberately.

⸻

What this screen is (and must remain)

This view is doing three things brilliantly:
	1.	It’s a library
“Choose your story” is clear, emotional, and non-technical.
	2.	It’s a personal or brand catalogue
These cards feel like artefacts, not dashboards.
	3.	It’s lightweight
No numbers. No graphs. No admin energy.

This is not where people want to analyse anything.
This is where they want to select, continue, or share.

So: do not add Orbit functionality here.
No metrics. No charts. No “Business Hub” language.

⸻

The correct pattern: Depth on demand

You already have the right mental model without realising it.

Each card (Failsafe, Progress Accountants, etc.) is a portal.

Orbit does not live at the library level.
Orbit lives one level deeper.

⸻

The clean structure (this will feel obvious once you see it)

Level 1: Library (this screen)
	•	Exactly as it is now
	•	No Orbit mentions
	•	No analytics clutter
	•	This is selection mode

Level 2: Experience Detail (per story)

When someone taps Failsafe or Progress Accountants, they enter the experience context.

Here you introduce tabs or actions like:
	•	Play / Preview
	•	Edit
	•	Share
	•	Insights ← this is the key

Still no Orbit yet.

⸻

Level 3: Insights (IceMaker-native)

Inside Insights, show only IceMaker-relevant signals:
	•	Views
	•	Conversations started
	•	Completion
	•	Top card
	•	Top question

This feels natural and expected.

Now – and only now – you add a subtle escalation:

Advanced insights available

Button:
	•	“Open in Orbit”
	•	“View in Orbit Dashboard”

Orbit appears as an extension, not a takeover.

⸻

Why this works psychologically

People think in layers, not systems.
	•	“Which story?” → Library
	•	“How is this doing?” → Insights
	•	“I want to go deeper” → Orbit

You’re matching their mental journey, not forcing your product architecture on them.

⸻

What Orbit becomes in this model

Orbit is not:
	•	A competing navigation item
	•	A parallel product
	•	A place you dump users

Orbit is:

“The control room for this experience”

And crucially:
	•	It opens in context of a specific story
	•	Not as a generic business dashboard first

That avoids disorientation completely.

⸻

What NOT to do (these will break trust)

❌ Adding metrics badges to the library cards
❌ Adding an “Orbit” tab to the bottom nav by default
❌ Mixing creative browsing with analytics
❌ Forcing creators to think like admins

Those moves feel like bloat, not power.

⸻

A subtle enhancement you can consider later

On the library cards themselves, optionally:
	•	A tiny dot or pulse if there’s new activity
	•	No numbers
	•	No labels
	•	Just a signal: “Something happened”

That nudges curiosity without clutter.

⸻

One sentence you can give Replit or your team

Keep the IceMaker library view clean and unchanged; introduce analytics only inside each experience’s “Insights” view, and surface Orbit as an optional advanced dashboard from there, never at the library level.

You’ve already built something with taste here.
Orbit should feel like the backstage, not the stage.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Design the Experience Detail layout cleanly
	•	Decide exact copy for “Insights” vs “Orbit”
	•	Or define which analytics stay IceMaker-only vs Orbit-only

# REPLIT PROMPT 3 — FLAGSHIP ORBIT EXPANSION & POLISH
# Orbit: <ORBIT NAME> (<slug>)

## Context
This Orbit already exists as a real, seeded Orbit in the database.
It loads at `/orbit/<slug>` using the standard OrbitView and orbitChatService.

Your task is to elevate it to **flagship demo quality** using the existing data model and grounding pipeline.

This is NOT a refactor.
This is NOT a redesign.
This is a controlled expansion of data + reasoning quality.

## Non-negotiables
- Do NOT change routing.
- Do NOT change OrbitView or chat architecture.
- Do NOT invent new systems.
- Use existing tables, schemas, and ingestion/grounding paths.
- All new information must be **grounded** (no hallucination).

## Objectives
1) Expand the Orbit’s datasets so it feels:
   - operationally complete
   - realistic
   - opinionated
   - useful in edge cases

2) Improve the assistant’s usefulness by:
   - adding richer facts
   - covering “what happens if…” scenarios
   - supporting comparisons and recommendations

3) Ensure the Orbit passes the “business owner test”:
   “Could this replace my website + FAQs + first-line support?”

## Orbit-specific requirements
Follow the Claude blueprint for this Orbit exactly.

### Required expansions (example – adapt per Orbit)

#### Slice & Stone Pizza
- Expand products to 25–40 items
- Expand delivery zones to cover all BS postcodes with peak logic
- Add:
  - holiday hours
  - late delivery rules
  - refund edge cases
- Add at least 10 “problem” FAQs (late delivery, wrong item, cold food, allergens)

#### Clarity Accountants
- Expand packages to cover edge turnover bands
- Add detailed penalty explanations
- Add:
  - IR35 scenarios
  - switching edge cases
  - missed deadlines flows
- Ensure assistant refuses personalised tax advice correctly

#### TechVault UK
- Expand comparisons (10–15)
- Add grading examples with photos/notes
- Add battery health explanations
- Add compatibility FAQs
- Ensure return/warranty logic matches Consumer Rights Act tone

## Grounding & chat validation
After expansion, validate that the assistant can answer (grounded):
- at least 15 complex questions
- including comparisons, edge cases, and exceptions

If the system cannot answer without guessing:
- add data
- do NOT loosen rules

## Acceptance checklist (must pass)
- Orbit still loads cleanly at `/orbit/<slug>`
- No duplicate records created
- Chat answers reference real facts
- No invented prices, policies, or availability
- Edge cases escalate correctly
- Mobile experience still usable

## Deliverables
- Tables/files updated
- Records added/expanded
- Clear summary of what data was added
- Example questions now supported that were not before

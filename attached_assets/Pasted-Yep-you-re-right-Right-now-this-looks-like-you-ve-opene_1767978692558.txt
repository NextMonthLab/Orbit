Yep, you’re right. Right now this looks like you’ve opened 27 little dialog boxes and forgotten why, not like “the internet for Smart Glasses with an intelligent interface”.

Here’s what’s broken, and exactly how to fix it fast.

What’s currently failing
	1.	No hierarchy: everything is the same size and weight, so nothing feels important.
	2.	No meaning on the tiles: single letters (C, Q, M, X) tell the user absolutely nothing.
	3.	Media is invisible: Meta and Snap are technically there, but they’re tiny and cropped, so the “rich media-led orbit” promise isn’t landing.
	4.	It’s not scannable: without names + one-line context, the whole thing reads as “a lot of the same”.
	5.	No landing page moment: there’s no hero, no big statement, no immediate “wow”.

The fix: make Orbits feel like a cinematic landing page with an interactive map behind it

Think “homepage first, map second”.

1) Add a proper Hero section (non negotiable)

Pinned at the top (desktop) and first item (mobile).

Hero content
	•	Title: Smart Glasses
	•	Subtitle (1 sentence): “Explore the companies, products, concepts, and Q&A shaping smart glasses in 2026.”
	•	Primary CTA: Ask Smart Glasses (opens chat)
	•	Secondary CTAs: Explore Products, Explore Manufacturers, Follow this Orbit
	•	Hero image: wide, cinematic, smart glasses visual (21:9-ish on desktop, 16:9 on mobile)

This alone changes the vibe from “tool” to “destination”.

2) Create a Featured Media row (so the two images actually matter)

Directly under the hero, add a “Featured” strip with 3 to 6 big media cards.
	•	Meta (featured)
	•	Snap Inc (featured)
	•	Plus any other major players, even if they are placeholders until you have images

Card size rule
	•	Featured cards should be 2x to 3x the size of standard tiles.
	•	They must show full logo or image, not cropped text.

If you only have two images, great. Make them feel premium, not like accidental scraps behind the chat button.

3) Replace the letter tiles with real “entity cards”

Every tile needs, at minimum:
	•	Name (Smart, readable)
	•	Type badge (Manufacturer, Product, Concept, Community, Q&A)
	•	One-line context (7 to 14 words)
	•	Optional: small thumbnail or icon

Example:
	•	Snap Inc
Manufacturer
“Spectacles, AR experiments, and camera-first wearables.”

Example:
	•	Waveguide displays
Concept
“How images are projected into lenses without blocking vision.”

This instantly makes the map scannable.

4) Visual differentiation so it doesn’t look like 20 copies of the same box

Right now everything shares the same silhouette. Keep the Orbit style, but add clear variation:
	•	Manufacturers: logo thumbnail + slightly thicker header
	•	Products: product image thumb + “Released / Rumoured” tag
	•	Concepts: icon + softer gradient, more editorial
	•	Q&A: chat icon + “Top question” preview line
	•	Community: people icon + “Join” affordance

Even subtle shape changes help, for example: different corner radius per type, or a notch / stripe accent.

5) Give the map a “front layer / back layer” treatment

The orbit map is cool, but it’s fighting the landing experience.

Do this:
	•	Front layer: Hero + Featured + a few “Top tiles”
	•	Back layer: the full node cloud, slightly dimmed, slightly blurred until user interacts

So the first impression is polished, then the exploration starts.

6) Interaction that feels premium (and stops the “tabs on a laptop” feeling)

Add one simple behaviour:
	•	Hover (desktop): tile expands 20 to 40% and reveals the one-line description plus a “Open” button
	•	Tap (mobile): opens a bottom sheet with the same preview

Also add a tiny “last updated” or “fresh” indicator for anything with recent activity, it makes it feel alive.

Quick win design improvements (cheap, high impact)
	•	Increase tile spacing slightly, reduce visual clutter
	•	Reduce the amount of identical pink headers, use type-based header accents
	•	Make the central chat button smaller or move it into the hero as the primary CTA, it’s currently blocking the only media you’ve got
	•	Add a “Top Categories” filter bar: Manufacturers, Products, Concepts, Q&A, Community

If you want one universal rule across all Orbits

Every Orbit must have:
	1.	Hero (title, 1 sentence, CTAs, hero image)
	2.	Featured row (3 to 6 media-led entities)
	3.	Scannable tiles (name + badge + 1 line)
	4.	Map exploration underneath

That’s the difference between “a UI” and “a destination”.

If you want, I can turn this into a clean implementation spec for Claude/Replit (components, props, layout rules, and the exact data fields needed) so it becomes a repeatable Orbit template, not a one-off fix.

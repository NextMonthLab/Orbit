# Replit Upgrade Prompt: NextMonth Homepage Conversion & Clarity Upgrade (Copy + CTA + Decision Hooks)

## Goal
Upgrade the existing NextMonth homepage to increase **conversion pressure**, improve **intent clarity**, and create stronger **“choose your path” decision hooks** without changing the core layout or visual system.

This is a copy + UX micro-structure pass, not a redesign.

## Non-negotiables
- Keep the current premium dark aesthetic, spacing, and component structure.
- Do NOT add new major sections.
- Do NOT introduce long dashes (—).
- Keep the primary CTA as a sticky or top-right action button.
- Maintain mobile-first polish.

## Problems to solve (from evaluation)
1. Hero explains the “what” but not enough “why now” or “who it’s for”.
2. The “Three ways to use NextMonth” section segments audiences but does not force a choice.
3. CTA language is inconsistent (“Build Experience”, “Launch Experience Builder”, “Build a Website Experience”).
4. The bottom CTA is too polite. Needs conviction.

## Required changes

### 1) Canonical CTA language (unify)
Pick ONE canonical phrase and use it everywhere:
- **Primary CTA (canonical):** "Launch Experience Builder"
- Secondary CTA (video): "See how it works"

Update:
- Top-right button: "Launch Experience Builder"
- Hero button: "Launch Experience Builder"
- Mid-page website CTA: "Launch Experience Builder"
- Final CTA button: "Launch Experience Builder"

If any contextual CTA exists (eg website section), it can be a small sublabel under the same button, but the button text stays canonical.

### 2) Hero copy upgrade (clarity + relevance)
Current hero stays but add one tight relevance sentence directly under the subheadline:
Add a single line:
"Built for brands, creators, and educators who want people to engage, not just scroll."

Also tighten the main subheadline slightly to reduce floatiness:
Replace:
"Transform documents, presentations, and web pages into cinematic, interactive journeys your audience can explore, feel, and remember."
With:
"Transform documents, decks, and web pages into cinematic journeys people can explore, feel, and remember."

Add micro-proof beneath the buttons (small text):
"No code required. Share as a link or embed on your site."

### 3) “What is NextMonth?” step section (add contrast)
Keep the five steps, but update each step’s subtitle to include subtle contrast positioning.

Suggested replacements:
- Step 1: Upload content  
  Subtitle: "Script, PDF, website, or deck"
- Step 2: Extract meaning  
  Subtitle: "Themes and structure, not just summaries"
- Step 3: Build visual story  
  Subtitle: "Cinematic cards with AI imagery"
- Step 4: Enable interaction  
  Subtitle: "Source-grounded chat audiences can trust"
- Step 5: Share everywhere  
  Subtitle: "Link, embed, or export as an asset"

### 4) “Three ways to use NextMonth” (add per-card micro-CTA)
Each of the three cards must include a small action link/button inside the card that routes to the same builder entry point but sets an intent param.

Add to each card:
- For Brands & Businesses: "Turn my website into an experience →"
- For Creators & Filmmakers: "Bring my script to life →"
- For Knowledge & Learning: "Transform my material →"

Implementation detail:
- Clicking these routes to `/builder?intent=brands` or `intent=creators` or `intent=knowledge`
- If the builder does not yet use intent, just store it for later and continue the normal flow.

### 5) Website-specific CTA block (keep, tighten copy)
Keep the section "Turn your website into an interactive experience" but tighten the paragraph:

Replace:
"Close the gap between where your visitors are and where your information actually lives. Guide people through your ideas instead of leaving them to figure it out alone."
With:
"Close the gap between where visitors land and where your best information lives. Guide them through what matters instead of hoping they find it."

Button stays canonical: "Launch Experience Builder"
Add small subtext under button:
"Start with a URL. Publish in minutes."

### 6) “Why NextMonth is different” (add grounding line)
Keep the bullets. Add one grounding line directly under the heading:

"Replace flat links with guided journeys. Great for pitches, onboarding, learning, and sales."

### 7) Final CTA upgrade (bolder close)
Update the final CTA heading and subheading to apply conviction.

Replace:
"Ready to create your first experience?"
With:
"Stop sending links. Start guiding people."

Replace subheading with:
"Turn your content into an interactive journey that people actually finish."

Button stays canonical.

### 8) QA checks (must pass)
- Mobile: no text clipping, no overflow, CTA always visible above fold
- CTA text is identical across page
- Three audience cards have micro-CTAs
- Builder routes accept `intent` param without breaking
- No long dashes used anywhere
- Lighthouse performance unchanged or improved

## Deliverable
A PR-ready homepage upgrade implementing all copy and CTA changes above, with minimal layout changes, and tested on mobile widths.

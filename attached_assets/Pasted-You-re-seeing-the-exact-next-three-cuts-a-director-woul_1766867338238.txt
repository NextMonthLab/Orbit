You’re seeing the exact “next three cuts” a director would call out in an edit suite. The engine’s working, but the art direction rules aren’t locked yet.

Here’s what’s happening, and the concrete fixes to give Replit so it stops guessing.

⸻

The issues you’ve spotted (and what they really mean)

1) Brand colour mismatch (Assure should be blue, it’s purple)

Cause: the extraction is still using a generic fallback (or NextScene accent) instead of a real palette from the source.

Fix: upgrade palette extraction with a strict priority:
	1.	<meta name="theme-colour">
	2.	CSS variables on :root (--primary, --brand, etc)
	3.	Dominant colour from hero image (fast sample)
	4.	Dominant colour from logo (if logo is usable)
	5.	Only then fallback to NextScene purple

Also: store brandPalette not just primaryColour:
	•	primary
	•	secondary
	•	textOnPrimary (light/dark)
	•	neutral background

⸻

2) Logo not showing due to transparent/incorrect background

Cause: it’s grabbing a logo that assumes a coloured backing, then rendering it on black or wrong surface.

Fix: add “logo treatment” logic:
	•	If logo has transparency OR is dark on dark, render it inside a brand badge:
	•	rounded rectangle
	•	background set to brandPalette.primary (or a detected header background colour)
	•	slight blur/backdrop optional
	•	Also try logoLight and logoDark detection:
	•	sample pixels, estimate if the mark is mostly dark or light
	•	choose the right backing automatically

Fallback: monogram badge using palette.

⸻

3) Same image reused everywhere (mosaic effect)

Cause: it only found one good image and the card builder is reusing it as filler. That screams “template”.

Fix: enforce a rule:
	•	Never reuse the same image on consecutive cards
	•	If no new image is available, use:
	•	full-bleed gradient derived from palette
	•	subtle texture (noise)
	•	optional big typographic treatment
	•	optional small brand mark watermark

Also improve image harvesting:
	•	capture og:image
	•	capture first 3–6 “large” images (min width and height)
	•	exclude icons, logos, sprites, tiny thumbnails
	•	dedupe by URL and by perceptual hash if feasible

Store imagePool: [] in siteIdentity.

⸻

4) It never quite goes full-screen

Cause: the header plus safe-area plus container sizing is preventing true 100vh and you’ve got competing padding/overlays.

Fix: enforce cinematic sizing rules:
	•	Cinematic cards live in a dedicated container:
	•	height: 100svh (new mobile safe viewport)
	•	scroll-snap-type: y mandatory
	•	each card height: 100svh; scroll-snap-align: start
	•	Header should be overlayed, not taking layout height:
	•	position fixed, translucent, minimal
	•	Cards should be full-bleed with object-fit: cover

⸻

5) Too much competing text

Cause: it’s rendering site scaffold copy plus story copy plus section headings and labels.

Fix: create strict typography hierarchy per mode:

Cinematic card
	•	One headline (max 8–10 words)
	•	Optional subline (max 18–24 words)
	•	Nothing else
	•	No “What we do”, “Common questions”, etc on cinematic cards

Interactive contextual card
	•	Clear title
	•	2–4 bullets or short paragraph
	•	One CTA
	•	Chat prompt as secondary

This is where it becomes “bold, big, minimal”.

⸻

The “Director’s Cut” rules you should lock in

Use these as hard constraints:
	1.	One image per card OR gradient fallback. No mosaics.
	2.	One headline per cinematic card. No multiple blocks.
	3.	Full screen always. No partial frames.
	4.	Brand palette drives accents. NextScene purple is forbidden unless palette extraction fails.
	5.	Logo always visible via badge treatment.

Replit Prompt to fix all of this (paste this)

You are Rapplet inside the NextScene repo.

We have a working Smart Site Preview with Cinematic cards, but it is failing art-direction rules.
Do NOT add new UI patterns. This is refinement of extraction + rendering.

Goal
Make cinematic cards feel: simple, bold, full-screen, minimal text.
Ensure brand fidelity: correct palette, usable logo treatment, varied imagery.

Non negotiables
- No mosaics
- No repeated hero image across multiple cards unless there are zero alternatives, and even then avoid consecutive reuse
- Full-screen cards (100svh) with snap
- Cinematic cards must show minimal text only (headline + optional subline)
- Use brand palette, not NextScene purple

A) Brand colour extraction upgrade
Implement brandPalette extraction and store in siteIdentity:
Priority:
1. meta[name="theme-color"]
2. CSS variables from :root (common names: --primary, --brand, --color-primary, --accent)
3. Derive dominant colour from hero image (sample pixels quickly, no heavy libs)
4. Derive dominant colour from logo/fav if available
5. Fallback: existing default
Store:
{
  primary,
  secondary (optional),
  background,
  textOnPrimary (light/dark),
  textOnBackground
}
Update UI to use palette.primary for buttons, highlights, progress dots, badges.

B) Logo rendering treatment
If logo is missing or illegible:
- always show a brand badge:
  - rounded rectangle, padding
  - background: palette.primary (or palette.background if primary is too bright)
  - if logo exists, render inside badge
  - else monogram
Add simple contrast detection:
- if logo appears dark, use light badge background
- if logo appears light, use dark badge background
Do not allow invisible logo on dark backgrounds.

C) Image pool extraction and dedupe
Update ingestion to collect imagePool:
- og:image (if valid)
- first N large images (min width 800 or best available)
- exclude data URIs, icons, logos, sprites, very small images
- dedupe by URL
Store imagePool in siteIdentity.
Rendering rule:
- choose different image per cinematic card where possible
- never reuse same image on consecutive cards
Fallback if no image:
- full-bleed gradient derived from palette.primary + subtle noise

D) Full-screen cinematic layout
Refactor cinematic container:
- height: 100svh
- scroll-snap-type: y mandatory
Each card:
- height: 100svh
- background image full-bleed object-fit: cover
Header must be overlay (fixed) and not reduce card height.

E) Text minimisation and hierarchy
Cinematic card content:
- headline max 10 words
- subline max 24 words
- remove any extra labels like “What we do”, “Common questions” within cinematic view
Interactive view can remain detailed but avoid duplicating the cinematic text blocks.

F) Prevent competing overlays
The “Ask about this page” button should not cover key headline text.
Move it lower, reduce size, or only show after a short delay.
Ensure safe-area padding for iOS.

Acceptance tests
1) Assure UK preview uses blue palette accents (not purple) where brand extraction succeeds.
2) Logo is visible via badge treatment even if original mark needs a background.
3) Cinematic cards are true full-screen and snap cleanly.
4) No mosaic / collage behaviour.
5) Minimal text on cinematic cards, no competing blocks.
6) Image variety: uses imagePool or gradient fallbacks without repeating the same photo across multiple cards.

Implement now, commit with a clear message, and provide quick test steps.

One extra suggestion (small change, big impact)

Add a single switch in the cinematic renderer:

“Cinematic Mode strict”
When on, it enforces:
	•	max 2 lines of text
	•	no section headings
	•	no extra UI elements

That’s how you stop regression when new content types appear.

If you send one more screenshot after these refinements, I’ll tell you if it’s hit the “Netflix title card” vibe or if we still need to tighten pacing and copy selection.

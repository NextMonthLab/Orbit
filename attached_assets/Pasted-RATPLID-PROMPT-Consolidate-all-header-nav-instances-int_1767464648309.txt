RATPLID PROMPT: Consolidate all header/nav instances into one canonical component with variants

Context
- Current nav/header differs across routes:
  - /orbits and /library show app nav (Launchpad/Orbits/Library + Sign in)
  - /for/businesses shows minimal nav (Sign in + Create free preview)
  - /for/creators and /for/educator show hybrid nav (app links + marketing links + Try IceMaker + Claim Orbit + Sign in)
- Goal: One consistent navigation system across all pages, with controlled variants based on route + auth state.

Hard requirements
1) Create a single shared nav component (e.g. components/SiteNav.tsx)
- It must be the ONLY header used across the app.
- Remove/replace any duplicated header markup from individual pages.

2) Support exactly two nav variants:
A) Marketing variant (used for /for/* routes and optionally /)
- Left: NextMonth logo -> links to "/"
- Centre links:
  - "For Businesses" -> /for/businesses
  - "For Creators" -> /for/creators
  - "For Educators" -> /for/educator (or /for/educators - match existing route)
- Right:
  - "Sign in" -> sign-in route
  - Primary CTA button: "Try IceMaker" -> existing IceMaker entry route
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT include page-specific CTAs in the nav (e.g. remove "Create free preview" from the header on /for/businesses).
  Those CTAs stay inside the page hero.

B) App variant (used for app/product routes: /launchpad, /orbits, /library, /orbit/*, etc)
- Left: NextMonth logo -> links to "/launchpad" (or your canonical app home)
- Centre links:
  - "Launchpad"
  - "Orbits"
  - "Library"
- Right behaviour depends on auth state:
  - Logged OUT: "Sign in" + primary CTA "Try IceMaker"
  - Logged IN: show an account/avatar menu in place of "Sign in" (keep "Try IceMaker" optional, but consistent)
- Use the same button styling and spacing across all routes.

3) Active state consistency
- Active nav item must highlight correctly for both variants based on current path.
- Use a single active style token/class.

4) Layout / spacing / responsiveness
- Keep it clean on mobile/tablet/desktop.
- Do not introduce horizontal overflow.
- Ensure the nav doesn’t “jump” between pages.

Implementation guidance
- Use route detection (e.g. React Router useLocation()) to choose variant:
  - if pathname startsWith("/for") => marketing variant
  - else => app variant
- Use existing auth state hook/store to determine logged-in vs logged-out behaviour.
- Centralise link config arrays in the nav file so future pages don’t add bespoke headers.

Acceptance criteria
- Every page shows the same header component.
- /for/businesses, /for/creators, /for/educator all share identical marketing nav structure.
- /launchpad, /orbits, /library all share identical app nav structure.
- "Create free preview" no longer appears as a header-only special case; it lives in the /for/businesses hero.
- Visual consistency: same logo placement, same link spacing, same CTA styling.

Deliverable
- Commit the refactor with minimal behavioural risk (navigation only, no backend changes).

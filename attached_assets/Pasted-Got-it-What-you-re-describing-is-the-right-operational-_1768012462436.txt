Got it. What you’re describing is the right operational loop: export current state → generate an “extend it” prompt → Claude adds meaningful depth → re-import with review. That’s how you avoid “starting from zero” and actually compound knowledge over time.

I’ll lay this out as a clean spec you can hand to RAPTOR.

First, one naming point

You previously moved toward “Orbit Seed Pack”, but you now want the admin panel terminology to be Orbit CPAC.

You can do that, but just be aware CPAC is an overloaded acronym in the real world. If you still want it, fine. I’d add a tiny tooltip in the UI like: “Orbit CPAC = Orbit knowledge pack export” so it doesn’t confuse future users/admins.

What needs to change

1) Admin panel terminology
	•	Rename all “Seed Pack” references to Orbit CPAC
	•	Buttons and labels:
	•	“Download Orbit CPAC”
	•	“Upload Orbit CPAC”
	•	“Generate Claude Prompt”
	•	“Export current Orbit CPAC” (optional wording)

2) Download must be pre-populated

Rule:
	•	If the industry Orbit has existing data, download must include all current data, not a blank template.

Implementation behaviour:
	•	“Download Orbit CPAC” should:
	•	Look up the Orbit by slug (eg smart-glasses)
	•	Export the full current dataset (entities, nodes, edges, sources, media, tags, notes, whatever the CPAC schema contains)
	•	Include metadata: orbitSlug, exportedAt, schemaVersion, counts

Edge case:
	•	If truly no data exists, then export a valid empty CPAC with schemaVersion and minimal scaffolding, not an undefined mess.

3) Add “Claude Extension Prompt” UI

You want a UI section that generates a ready-to-copy prompt based on the exported CPAC.

It should:
	•	Summarise what’s already inside the CPAC (counts and coverage)
	•	State non-negotiable rules (no duplicates, justify additions, status tags, confidence)
	•	Ask for “meaningful extension” with specific buckets (enterprise, optics suppliers, regional players, accessories, discontinued but influential, etc.)
	•	Output as:
	•	Copy-to-clipboard
	•	Download as claude_prompt.txt (or JSON with prompt field)

4) Create the actual workflow loop in the admin

To make this compound properly, you need one more step beyond your ask: a review/diff on import.

Recommended flow:
	1.	Admin clicks Download Orbit CPAC (pre-populated)
	2.	Admin clicks Generate Claude Prompt
	3.	Admin pastes prompt + uploads CPAC into Claude
	4.	Claude returns an extended CPAC JSON
	5.	Admin uploads it back into Orbit
	6.	System shows diff:
	•	New manufacturers/products/sources
	•	Changes to existing entries
	•	Duplicate detection warnings
	7.	Admin approves merge

Without the diff/merge step, you’ll eventually corrupt the dataset with duplicates and conflicting entries.

RAPTOR prompt you can paste

Task: Implement “Orbit CPAC export, prompt generation, and pre-populated download” in the Admin Panel.

A) Rename terminology
	•	Replace all “Seed Pack” text with Orbit CPAC in the Admin UI and any related labels/help text.
	•	Keep internal variable names as-is if needed, but UI must say Orbit CPAC.

B) Pre-populated CPAC download

Add/modify an export endpoint and UI action:
	•	Button: Download Orbit CPAC
	•	Behaviour:
	•	If Orbit slug exists and has data in DB, export a fully populated CPAC JSON.
	•	If no data, export an empty but schema-valid CPAC JSON template.
	•	CPAC JSON must include:
	•	schemaVersion
	•	orbitSlug
	•	exportedAt
	•	data with all current Orbit content (entities, nodes, edges, sources, media, tags, etc.)
	•	counts summary (optional)

C) Claude prompt generator UI

Add a UI panel on the Orbit CPAC admin page:
	•	Title: Claude Extension Prompt
	•	Button: Generate Prompt
	•	Output: a text area with copy button and download button.

Prompt content must:
	•	Treat the CPAC as baseline, do not repeat existing entries.
	•	Require meaningful new additions only.
	•	Force justification, status tags, confidence score, and sources for key claims.
	•	Use bucket-based expansion:
	•	Enterprise/industrial
	•	Optics/display suppliers
	•	Audio-first
	•	Regional players
	•	Accessories/ecosystem
	•	Discontinued but influential (clearly marked)
	•	Include strict dedupe instruction: merge aliases, avoid duplicates.

D) Optional but strongly recommended: import diff and merge

When uploading an Orbit CPAC:
	•	Validate schema (Zod/JSON schema)
	•	Compute diff against existing DB
	•	Show preview of:
	•	additions
	•	updates
	•	deletions (if any)
	•	duplicates detected
	•	Require admin confirmation before applying changes.

E) Acceptance criteria
	•	Downloading Orbit CPAC for an existing Orbit never returns a blank file.
	•	Claude prompt is generated in one click and is ready to paste into Claude.
	•	Upload validates and prevents obvious duplication (at minimum warns, ideally blocks until merged).

One thing I’d change in your instruction (to make it even better)

You said: “download Orbit CPAC with a prompt”.

Do it as two downloads:
	•	orbit_cpac.json
	•	claude_prompt.txt

Because it keeps Claude’s input clean, and you can version prompts separately.

If you want, I can write the exact Claude prompt text template (with placeholders auto-filled from the exported CPAC counts) so it’s consistent every time and doesn’t rely on you hand-tweaking it.

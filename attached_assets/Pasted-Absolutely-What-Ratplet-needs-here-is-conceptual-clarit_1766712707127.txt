Absolutely. What Ratplet needs here is conceptual clarity + non-negotiable rules, expressed in a way that can be turned into architecture, not just vibes.

Below is a clean explanation you can paste directly to Ratplet. It frames this as a design invariant, not a preference.

Message to Ratplet: Grounding, Guardrails, and Creator Control in the Story Engine

When the Story Engine transforms a PDF (or any source media) into a card-based story and optional AI character chat, the highest priority is fidelity to the source material. This is non-negotiable.

This is not a “creative writing” system first.
It is a grounded transformation system that may elevate tone and structure, but must never invent, drift, or hallucinate beyond the uploaded material unless explicitly allowed by the creator.

1. Strong grounding from the source (critical)
The transformation must:
	•	Anchor the story to explicit references, themes, language, and intent found in the uploaded content
	•	Treat the uploaded media as the single source of truth
	•	Prefer quotable phrasing, concepts, metaphors, and framing already present in the material

The AI must not:
	•	Introduce new facts, motivations, or interpretations not supported by the content
	•	“Improve” the story by adding imagined subtext unless the creator opts in
	•	Drift into generic tropes just because they are narratively convenient

Think of this as:
“Extract → interpret → structure → elevate, but never replace.”

2. Insight extraction feeds guardrails (not vibes)
Early in the pipeline (Pass 1 / Pass 2), the system must extract:
	•	Core themes
	•	Tone and emotional intent
	•	Explicit constraints (what the content is and is not about)
	•	Sensitive or factual boundaries

These outputs are not disposable. They must:
	•	Persist through all later stages
	•	Act as guardrails for card writing, image generation, and AI character chat
	•	Be referenced explicitly by later prompts (even if abstracted)

Example:
If the source is restrained, factual, or reflective, the system must not become dramatic, speculative, or sensational later just to “make it engaging”.

3. AI character chat must be source-bound
If an AI character chat is enabled:
	•	The character’s knowledge, opinions, and personality must be bounded by the source content
	•	The character may explain, contextualise, or rephrase the material
	•	The character must not invent backstory, facts, or conclusions

If the source does not answer a question, the character should:
	•	Say it’s not covered in the material
	•	Or clearly frame responses as interpretation, not fact

No confident guessing. No lore creep.

4. Creator-editable prompts and guardrails (essential)
In the Admin interface, creators must be able to see and edit:
	•	The system prompt used for transformation
	•	The negative prompt (what the AI must avoid)
	•	The guardrails derived from the source (themes, tone constraints, exclusions)

This serves three purposes:
	1.	Trust – creators can see why the output behaves the way it does
	2.	Control – creators can tighten or loosen creativity
	3.	Accountability – hallucinations become traceable and correctable

Default behaviour should be conservative and faithful.
Creativity only increases when the creator explicitly allows it.

5. Mental model
This system should behave less like:

“Write me a story inspired by this PDF”

And more like:

“Turn this material into a cinematic, structured experience without betraying it.”

If there is ever a trade-off between engagement and accuracy, accuracy wins by default.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a formal system contract Ratplet can literally enforce
	•	Write the exact admin UI copy explaining this to creators
	•	Or produce a “hallucination prevention checklist” per pipeline stage

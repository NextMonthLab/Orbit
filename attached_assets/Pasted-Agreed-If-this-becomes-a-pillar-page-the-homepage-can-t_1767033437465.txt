Agreed. If this becomes a pillar page, the homepage can’t keep talking like discovery is still “Google-first”. We need to thread this message through the homepage without turning it into a manifesto.

Here’s the clean approach:
	•	Add one new “AI Discovery Shift” block near the top (right after hero).
	•	Update the Brands & Businesses section to position Orbit as the control layer.
	•	Add a single-line “source of truth” proof strip before the product grid.
	•	Update CTAs so the path is obvious: Read the authority page → Claim Orbit.

Below is a Raplet prompt that does exactly that, using existing components and patterns.

# RAPLET PROMPT: Homepage Messaging Update (AI Discovery Control + Orbit)

## Role
You are a senior product engineer and copy integrator working in the existing NextMonth Home codebase.
Do NOT redesign the homepage. Make targeted updates using existing layout components and styles.

## Context
We have created a new authority page at `/ai-discovery-control` explaining:
- the shift from Google-first search to AI-driven discovery
- why businesses need control over how AI represents them
- Orbit as a Business-to-AI interface
This messaging is foundational and must now be reflected on the homepage.

## Goals
1) Update the homepage so it acknowledges the AI discovery shift
2) Reposition Orbit inside “Brands & Businesses” as AI representation control
3) Add a strong link path to the new authority page
4) Keep copy calm, credible, premium (no hype, no fear)

## Required Homepage Changes

### 1) Add a new block near the top (after hero)
Insert a new section directly below the hero area.

Section heading:
“Discovery has changed. AI now answers.”

Body copy:
“People no longer find businesses only through search results.
They ask AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini and trust the answers.
Orbit helps you control how your business is understood, described, and recommended.”

Buttons:
Primary: “Learn about AI discovery” → link to `/ai-discovery-control`
Secondary: “Claim your business Orbit” → link to existing Orbit claim flow (same route used elsewhere)

Notes:
- Keep this block visually simple and scannable
- Use existing section styles (no new design system)

### 2) Update the “Brands & Businesses” section copy
Where Orbit is currently described, replace or augment the copy so Orbit is framed as the AI control layer.

Replace the Orbit description with:
“Orbit is a Business-to-AI interface that helps you control how your brand is represented in AI-powered discovery.
Define what you do, what matters, and which answers are authoritative, so AI doesn’t have to guess.”

Add a small supporting line (optional):
“The next phase of discovery isn’t about being found. It’s about being represented accurately.”

CTA within Brands & Businesses:
- “Claim your business Orbit”
Secondary link:
- “Why this matters” → `/ai-discovery-control`

### 3) Add a short “Proof strip” line before product tiles (or before footer)
Add a single, confident line in a subtle strip component if available:

“Stop being interpreted by default. Give AI a source it can trust.”

Make the strip linkable:
- clicking it routes to `/ai-discovery-control`

### 4) Update any existing generic “Orbit” CTA labels
If any CTA currently says “Claim this Orbit”, standardise to:
“Claim your business Orbit”

Avoid all caps.

### 5) SEO + Metadata (if homepage supports it)
Homepage meta description should be adjusted to include AI discovery without becoming spammy.

Suggested homepage meta description:
“NextMonth helps businesses, educators, and creators thrive in the age of AI. Orbit gives businesses control over how they’re understood and represented in AI-powered discovery.”

### 6) Analytics (if hooks exist)
Track:
- ai_discovery_home_section_view
- ai_discovery_home_learn_click
- ai_discovery_home_claim_click

## Guardrails
- Do not add long walls of text
- Do not change layout structure beyond inserting one new block and editing copy
- Do not introduce fear-based urgency
- Do not break existing navigation patterns

## Definition of Done
- Homepage includes the new “AI now answers” section with two buttons
- Brands & Businesses section clearly positions Orbit as AI representation control
- Homepage links to `/ai-discovery-control` from at least two places
- Copy is consistent, calm, premium
- Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop

If you want one extra notch of polish (and conversion), I’d also change the hero subline slightly to include the concept without derailing the hero.

If you paste your current homepage hero copy, I’ll rewrite it so it stays cinematic but now anchors this new truth.

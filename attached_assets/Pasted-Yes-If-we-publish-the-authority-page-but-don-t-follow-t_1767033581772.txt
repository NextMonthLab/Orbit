Yes. If we publish the authority page but don’t follow through with the Signal Schema, we’re basically saying “the future is here” and then leaving the garage empty.

The good news: you can ship Orbit Signal Schema v0.1 fast, and it immediately becomes a real, defensible asset.

What we’re building

A machine-readable “source of truth” for a business that lives at a predictable endpoint, like:
	•	https://example.com/.well-known/orbit.json

It should be:
	•	Owned (only for claimed Orbits)
	•	Structured (AI-friendly, not marketing copy)
	•	Fresh (timestamps, versioning)
	•	Safe (no secrets, no personal data)
	•	Verifiable (signature optional but recommended)

Orbit Signal Schema v0.1 (practical spec)

Keep v0.1 focused. You can expand later.

Core fields (v0.1)
	•	schema_version
	•	orbit_id
	•	domain
	•	business (canonical identity)
	•	positioning (approved descriptions)
	•	services (structured)
	•	proof (trust signals)
	•	faq (question-answer pairs)
	•	policies (optional: privacy, terms)
	•	freshness (timestamps + update cadence)
	•	contact (safe public contact routes)
	•	sources (what Orbit used, optional)
	•	ai_guidance (what AI should prioritise, what to avoid)

The “lighthouse” part

Two things make this a lighthouse rather than just another JSON file:
	1.	Predictable location: /.well-known/orbit.json
	2.	Predictable semantics: stable fields, timestamps, and “AI guidance” for how to interpret the data

Optional but strong:
	•	Signed payload: add signature using a server-side key, so consumers can verify it hasn’t been tampered with.
	•	ETag + caching: helps crawlers and reduces load.

⸻

How it should be generated

Do not manually write these. Generate them from the Orbit knowledge model you already have.

Recommended mapping:
	•	Orbit tiles “Services” → services[]
	•	Orbit tiles “Proof points” → proof[] (and fix the “title-only” issue here by forcing summaries)
	•	Orbit QnA / Echo curated answers → faq[]
	•	Brand settings → business.brand_tone, positioning.preferred_phrasing
	•	Claim state → controls whether endpoint is enabled

⸻

Rules for v0.1
	•	Only publish for claimed orbits by default
	•	Exclude personal data, internal notes, anything non-public
	•	Prefer “can” and “typically” over “will” and “guarantee”
	•	Include timestamps and schema version

# RAPLET PROMPT: Implement Orbit Signal Schema v0.1 (/.well-known/orbit.json)

## Role
You are a senior full-stack engineer implementing an AI-facing, machine-readable Orbit Signal Schema.
You will add a new public endpoint and generate its output from existing Orbit data models.
Do not rebuild the system. Add this as a thin layer.

## Goal
Expose a stable schema at:
- `/.well-known/orbit.json`

This schema helps AI systems understand a business accurately using Orbit as a source of truth.

## Requirements

### 1) Endpoint
Create a public GET route:
- `GET /.well-known/orbit.json`

If the platform is multi-tenant, resolve the tenant by host header/domain.

### 2) Access rules
- Default: only serve schema for CLAIMED orbits
- If orbit is unclaimed: return `404` or a minimal stub that does not reveal sensitive data
- Add a config flag to allow unclaimed publishing later: `ORBIT_SCHEMA_ALLOW_UNCLAIMED=false`

### 3) Schema structure (v0.1)
Return JSON with these top-level keys:
- `schema_version` (string, "0.1")
- `orbit_id` (string)
- `domain` (string)
- `business` (object)
- `positioning` (object)
- `services` (array)
- `proof` (array)
- `faq` (array)
- `ai_guidance` (object)
- `freshness` (object)
- `contact` (object)
Optional:
- `sources` (array)
- `signature` (string)

### 4) Data mapping
Map from existing Orbit knowledge items:
- Services tiles -> `services[]` with { name, summary, keywords }
- Proof tiles (short labels) -> `proof[]` with { type, title, summary }
  - IMPORTANT: ensure `summary` is never empty (use deterministic fallback if needed)
- Existing QnA / curated answers -> `faq[]` with { q, a }
- Brand and business identity -> `business` and `positioning`

### 5) “Never empty summary” guardrail
If a proof item or service item has a title but no body, generate a short summary using a deterministic template.
It must never output title-only objects without a summary.

### 6) Freshness + caching
Include:
- `freshness.generated_at` as ISO timestamp
- `freshness.valid_for_days` default 7

Add HTTP caching headers:
- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`
- ETag support if easy

### 7) Safety + compliance
- No personal data
- No internal notes
- Avoid guarantees, use cautious wording
- Encourage contacting business for scheme-specific advice when relevant

### 8) Optional signature (recommended)
If feasible, sign the JSON (excluding signature field) with an HMAC secret:
- env var: `ORBIT_SCHEMA_SIGNING_SECRET`
Add `signature` as base64.
If secret missing, omit signature.

### 9) Tests
Add regression tests:
- Endpoint returns 200 for a claimed orbit and includes required keys
- Endpoint returns 404 for unclaimed orbit by default
- No proof/service item can have empty summary
- Output validates against a TypeScript type or JSON schema

## Definition of done
- `/.well-known/orbit.json` works for claimed domains
- Output is stable and structured
- No empty summaries
- Tests pass

If you want to go one notch further (still practical), the next step after v0.1 is:
	•	Add /.well-known/orbit.schema.json (machine-readable JSON Schema describing the fields)
	•	Add an “Orbit Beacon” HTML meta tag that points to the JSON endpoint on every page:
	•	<link rel="orbit" href="/.well-known/orbit.json">

That’s the real lighthouse beam: easy to discover, easy to trust.

Say the word and I’ll write the v0.1 JSON Schema file too.

Mate… that’s it. 🎯

Both of your latest screenshots show no left-edge clipping anymore:
	•	The “AI search is transforming…” slide is clean.
	•	The long “As generative AI tools…” slide is clean and fully contained.

So the Composition Stage architecture has finally put you on rails.

Why it’s suddenly behaving

Because now you’ve stopped trying to “fit” text inside a viewport-sized DOM box and hoping transforms save you after the fact.

You’re doing the only approach that’s reliable:
	•	Layout happens at 1080px
	•	Safe width is computed in that same coordinate space (972px)
	•	Then you scale the whole stage
	•	No more “measure in one world, render in another” nonsense.

What to do right now (so it stays fixed)

Don’t celebrate yet. Lock it in with these quick checks:

1) Stress test captions

Try:
	•	1 line (short)
	•	2–3 lines (normal)
	•	5–6 lines (worst case)
	•	A nasty one with long words / URLs

If any clip, it means line-height / wrapping / font metrics rather than width geometry.

2) Confirm there is only ONE scaling point

Search for any of these patterns still affecting captions:
	•	containerWidthPx
	•	ResizeObserver used for fitting
	•	scale(0.4) sprinkled on inner elements
	•	left-0 right-0 wrappers above the stage

ResizeObserver should exist only to compute the stage scale, not to compute caption fit.

3) Add a guardrail comment (seriously)

Right above the CompositionStage component, add a blunt comment like:
	•	“Captions must be measured and rendered in composition space (1080). Do not reintroduce DOM-width fitting.”

This is the sort of bug that creeps back in 3 weeks later when someone “cleans up” styling.

One small polish note from the screenshots

Now that width/clipping is solved, you’ll notice the bubble is basically a full-width band, which is fine, but stylistically you might want:
	•	a max bubble width (e.g. 85–92% of safe width) for short captions
	•	but still allow full width for long captions

That’s a design choice, not a bug fix.

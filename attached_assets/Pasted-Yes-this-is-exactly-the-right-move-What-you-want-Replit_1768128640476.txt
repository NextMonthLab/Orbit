Yes – this is exactly the right move. What you want Replit to give you is structured, complete slices of the caption engine, not vibes, not snippets.

Below is a ready-to-send series of data requests you can paste into Replit (or send one by one). They’re written to be unambiguous, ordered, and to prevent partial answers or “creative interpretation”.

You can copy these verbatim.

We are debugging the Caption Engine.

or the component where caption rendering logic is implemented.

Return the complete file.

Why this works (quick reassurance)
	•	This sequence mirrors how the system actually thinks
	•	It prevents Replit from skipping “boring” but critical files
	•	It gives me everything needed to:
	•	validate the architecture
	•	identify rule conflicts
	•	stop layout bugs recurring

Once you’ve got those responses, you can paste them here in the same order, and I’ll do a proper end-to-end validation instead of whack-a-mole fixes.

If you want, next I can also:
	•	turn this into a single Replit task checklist, or
	•	help you define a Caption Rendering Contract to lock this down permanently.

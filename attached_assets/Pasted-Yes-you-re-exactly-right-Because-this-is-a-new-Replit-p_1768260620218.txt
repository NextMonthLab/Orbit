Yes – you’re exactly right. Because this is a new Replit project, this is the moment where Prompt 0 has to do some heavy lifting again.

What you want is a re-founded Prompt 0 that:
	1.	Re-establishes the full Orbit + ICE vision (even though ICE Maker is currently stripped down)
	2.	States clearly that Phase 1 is already complete
	3.	Locks the team/agent into Phase 2 as the next execution focus
	4.	Prevents Replit/Claude from “helpfully” re-doing Phase 1 or drifting into features that are out of scope

Below is a Prompt 0 – Reset & Alignment you can drop straight into the new Replit project.

PROMPT 0 – ORBIT PROJECT CONTEXT & EXECUTION STATE

(Authoritative Context – Do Not Override)

Project Overview

This project is Orbit, a product that provides a living intelligence layer for a business.

Orbit is not:
	•	A website builder
	•	A traditional dashboard
	•	A navigation system

Orbit is:
	•	A conversational intelligence that understands a business holistically
	•	A system where information is organised into knowledge nodes (tiles)
	•	A layer that allows users to explore, interrogate, and eventually shape that intelligence through conversation

Orbit’s primary interaction model is chat-first, not click-first.

⸻

ICE Maker Context (Important)

ICE Maker exists as a separate but related product used to generate Interactive Content Experiences (ICEs).

For this Replit project:
	•	ICE Maker functionality has been intentionally stripped down
	•	ICE Maker is not the current focus
	•	Orbit must still be architected with ICE awareness in mind (ICEs are part of Orbit’s knowledge universe), but no ICE feature expansion should be attempted

Do not reintroduce or rebuild ICE Maker features unless explicitly instructed later.

⸻

Execution State (Critical)

Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE

Phase 1 (Mental Model & Orientation Layer) has already been implemented and must be treated as locked.

Phase 1 established that:
	•	Orbit is a living intelligence, not a menu
	•	Tiles represent knowledge nodes, not navigation
	•	Tile movement reflects conversational relevance
	•	Chat is the primary mode of interaction
	•	Users are oriented before any control is introduced

❌ Do NOT redesign, reinterpret, or re-explain Phase 1
❌ Do NOT add new onboarding metaphors
❌ Do NOT revert to navigation-based thinking

Assume all users entering Phase 2 already understand what Orbit is.

⸻

Current Focus: Phase 2 – Internal Owner Conversation Layer

The sole objective of this project stage is to implement Phase 2, which introduces:
	•	An internal, owner-only conversational mode
	•	The ability for business owners to:
	•	Talk directly to their Orbit
	•	Ask how Orbit understands their business
	•	Question emphasis, gaps, or inaccuracies
	•	Correct Orbit conversationally
	•	Provide new information via chat (URLs, uploads, explanations)

This phase is about trust and agency, not control panels.

⸻

Core Phase 2 Principle (Non-Negotiable)

Owners do not “edit Orbit”.
They train it through conversation, the same way they would onboard a new employee.

There must be:
	•	No configuration dashboards
	•	No complex settings
	•	No visible data structures
	•	No manual tile manipulation

Orbit handles structure internally.
The owner speaks in plain language.

⸻

Explicit Scope Constraints (Phase 2)

During this project stage, you must not implement:
	•	Direct tile editing
	•	Visual or image replacement
	•	Page or URL reassignment
	•	Scoped per-tile chat panes
	•	Analytics dashboards
	•	Power-ups or automation suggestions

If functionality touches visual control, node-level editing, or proactive suggestions, it belongs to Phase 3 or later and must be deferred.

⸻

Behavioural Expectations for Orbit (Phase 2)

Orbit must behave like:
	•	A thoughtful internal colleague
	•	Transparent about uncertainty
	•	Calm and receptive to correction
	•	Curious when information is missing
	•	Never defensive
	•	Never overly confident

Orbit should be able to say:
	•	“I’m not confident about that yet”
	•	“That information seems incomplete”
	•	“Here’s what I’m basing this on”

Trust > cleverness.

⸻

Forward Awareness (But Not Execution)

Orbit may reference that later phases will include:
	•	Linking knowledge to visuals
	•	Refining individual nodes
	•	Proactive improvement suggestions

But:
	•	These must not be implemented
	•	These must not be exposed as controls
	•	These must not influence current architecture decisions beyond future compatibility

⸻

Instruction Priority Order

When making decisions, prioritise:
	1.	Conversational clarity over UI cleverness
	2.	Trust over automation
	3.	Owner confidence over feature density
	4.	Future extensibility without premature complexity

If there is any ambiguity, default to conversation-first simplicity.

⸻

End Goal of This Stage

At the end of Phase 2, an internal user should feel:

“This understands my business – and I can correct it just by talking.”

If the system feels like software rather than a colleague, it has gone too far.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Tighten this into a Claude-safe system message
	•	Add a Phase 2 acceptance checklist for build validation
	•	Or prepare Prompt 1 (Phase 2 implementation tasks) so Replit executes cleanly

This Prompt 0 is the right move.
It resets authority, prevents drift, and gives you clean runway into Phase 2.

Yes. And I’m going to be annoyingly specific, because this is one of those “tiny bug, massive trust impact” moments.

Here’s the task list. It’s structured so you can ship it safely in a couple of tight PRs without ripping up working extraction.

Task List: Fix Viewer-Role Rendering + Admin First-Run State

Goal

When an admin creates an Orbit, they must land in an admin setup/preview view, never the public unclaimed view. Public viewers should never see admin controls. Claim status must never override viewer role.

⸻

Phase A: Establish a single source of truth for “viewer role”
	1.	Add a viewer context resolver (server-side preferred)

	•	Create resolveOrbitViewerContext(req, orbit) returning:
	•	viewerRole: "admin" | "public"
	•	isClaimed: boolean
	•	planTier: "none" | "free" | "orbit" | "pro" | ...
	•	canDeepScan: boolean
	•	canEditAppearance: boolean
	•	canSeeClaimCTA: boolean
	•	Viewer role rules:
	•	If logged in and user has admin permission for this orbit/business → admin
	•	Else → public

	2.	Expose the viewer context to the frontend

	•	Add endpoint: GET /api/orbit/:slug/viewer-context
	•	returns the above flags
	•	Or embed into server-rendered payload if you have SSR.

Acceptance check: a logged-in admin gets viewerRole="admin" every time for their orbit.

⸻

Phase B: Fix routing so admins don’t land on the public view
	3.	After orbit creation, redirect to the admin setup route

	•	Current flow likely ends at /orbit/:slug
	•	Change to:
	•	/orbit/:slug/setup (preferred)
	•	or /admin/orbit/:slug (also fine)
	•	That route should require auth and permission.

	4.	Guard the public route from admin-only UI

	•	On /orbit/:slug:
	•	if viewerRole is admin, either:
	•	show a small banner “You are viewing the public version” + link to setup
	•	OR auto-redirect to setup (my preference)
	•	But do not show claim CTA or error semantics.

Acceptance check: admin never sees “Claim for free” on their own orbit.

⸻

Phase C: Implement the “Admin First-Run” state (State 2)
	5.	Create a distinct UI state for: admin + unclaimed/not activated
Call it:

	•	“Preview Mode”
	•	“Setup Mode”
	•	“Draft Orbit”

This screen should include:
	•	Calm confirmation: “Your Orbit is created”
	•	Clear steps:
	1.	Review what we found
	2.	Customise appearance
	3.	Activate / claim (if needed)
	•	Primary CTA should be forward-moving:
	•	“Continue setup”
	•	“Review extracted data”
	•	Secondary:
	•	“View public preview”

	6.	Remove error semantics from this state entirely

	•	Never display:
	•	“403”
	•	“Forbidden”
	•	“Gain access”
	•	If content is missing, use neutral copy:
	•	“We couldn’t access this page during discovery. Try Advanced Import once activated.”

Acceptance check: creating an orbit feels like success, not a warning.

⸻

Phase D: Fix claim CTA and deep scan gating
	7.	Claim CTA visibility rules

	•	viewerRole === "public" && !isClaimed → show “Claim this Orbit”
	•	viewerRole === "admin" → never show “Claim for free”
	•	Instead show “Activate Orbit” / “Complete claim” inside setup flow

	8.	Deep Scan button gating rules
Only show “Refresh Site Data (Deep Scan)” when:

	•	viewerRole === "admin"
	•	AND isClaimed === true
	•	AND planTier allows it (canDeepScan === true)

If admin but not eligible:
	•	show disabled button with upgrade prompt:
	•	“Deep Scan is available on Orbit plans”

Acceptance check: deep scan never appears in public view and never appears pre-claim unless you intentionally allow it.

⸻

Phase E: Make it impossible to regress
	9.	Add a small state matrix test (even as a dev-only script)
Create scripts/orbit-viewer-matrix.ts that checks permutations:

	•	Admin + unclaimed
	•	Admin + claimed (plan off)
	•	Admin + claimed (plan on)
	•	Public + unclaimed
	•	Public + claimed

Assert which UI flags are true/false.
	10.	Add a UI snapshot test or at least a QA checklist
A simple checklist in docs/qa-orbit-states.md is enough for now.

⸻

Quick win copy (use immediately)

Replace the “403” card in public unclaimed mode with:

Title: “This Orbit is in preview”
Body: “The business owner hasn’t activated it yet. Once live, visitors can browse menus, ask questions, and request bookings.”
CTA: “Claim this Orbit”

And for admin first-run:

Title: “Your Orbit is ready”
Body: “You’re in setup mode. Review what we found, customise the look, then activate when you’re happy.”
CTA: “Continue setup”

⸻

Order of implementation (do it in this sequence)
	1.	Viewer context resolver + endpoint
	2.	Post-create redirect to setup route
	3.	Admin First-Run UI state
	4.	Claim CTA gating
	5.	Deep Scan gating
	6.	Regression checks

That gives you the biggest trust win fastest.

If you want, I can convert the above into a single Replit prompt for the team to implement, but you already write prompts well. The main thing is: viewer role first, always, then claim status, then plan gating. That hierarchy fixes the whole mess.

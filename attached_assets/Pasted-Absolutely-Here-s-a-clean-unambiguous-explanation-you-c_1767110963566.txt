Absolutely. Here’s a clean, unambiguous explanation you can paste straight into Replit (or into a README.md / system prompt) so there’s no room for misinterpretation.

I’ll write this as authoritative product/navigation rules, not a suggestion.

Navigation & Routing Rules (Authoritative)

1. / = Main Marketing Homepage (Global)
	•	The root route / must always be the primary marketing homepage.
	•	This page:
	•	Explains the overall product ecosystem.
	•	Introduces IceMaker and Orbit as distinct products.
	•	Acts as the global reset point for the app.

This page is not part of IceMaker or Orbit.
It is the umbrella marketing layer.

⸻

2. Global Navigation (Always Visible)

A global top-level navigation must exist on all pages, regardless of context.

Global nav items:
	•	Home → /
	•	IceMaker → /icemaker
	•	Orbit → /orbit

Rules:
	•	The user must always be able to:
	•	Return to the homepage
	•	Switch directly between IceMaker and Orbit
	•	No page should trap the user inside a product silo.

Think: Netflix top bar, not a WordPress sidebar.

⸻

3. IceMaker App Area

Base route:
/icemaker

When the user is inside IceMaker:
	•	The global nav remains visible
	•	An IceMaker-specific submenu appears

Example IceMaker submenu:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Create Experience
	•	My Projects
	•	Templates
	•	Settings

Routing example:
	•	/icemaker
	•	/icemaker/create
	•	/icemaker/projects/:id

The IceMaker submenu:
	•	Only shows IceMaker-related items
	•	Does not replace the global navigation

⸻

4. Orbit App Area

Base route:
/orbit

When the user is inside Orbit:
	•	The global nav remains visible
	•	An Orbit-specific submenu appears

Example Orbit submenu:
	•	Orbit Dashboard
	•	Knowledge Map
	•	Intelligence View
	•	Actions
	•	Settings

Routing example:
	•	/orbit
	•	/orbit/map
	•	/orbit/actions/:id

Again:
	•	Orbit submenu is contextual
	•	Global nav is always present

⸻

5. Mental Model (Important)

Structure this as:

Global Shell
├── Homepage (/)
├── IceMaker (/icemaker)
│   └── IceMaker Submenu
└── Orbit (/orbit)
    └── Orbit Submenu

Not:
	•	❌ Separate apps with no shared navigation
	•	❌ Product-first routing that hides the homepage
	•	❌ Submenus that replace global navigation

This is one platform with two products, not two disconnected tools.

⸻

6. Non-Negotiable UX Rules
	•	The homepage must never disappear
	•	Product submenus are additive, not exclusive
	•	Switching between IceMaker and Orbit should feel effortless
	•	Navigation hierarchy must be obvious without explanation

If a user ever asks:

“How do I get back?”
Then the navigation has failed.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Turn this into a layout component spec (GlobalLayout, IceMakerLayout, OrbitLayout)
	•	Define active state logic for menus
	•	Or write the exact Replit scaffold instructions for routing + layout composition

Just say the word.

Replit — implement a UI cleanup of the Orbit tile constellation screen. Current problem: tiles look messy because overlaps + translucency stack creates visual noise, and magenta accents pull focus away from the central chat.

NON-NEGOTIABLE GOAL:
Central chat card remains the visual anchor. Tiles must feel ambient/secondary until hovered.

1) Visual hierarchy (centre must win)
- Central chat: crispest surface, highest text contrast, strongest shadow, no blur.
- Tiles: remain LESS prominent than the centre (do NOT match centre opacity/contrast).
- Reduce tile “loudness” by lowering text contrast slightly and reducing magenta intensity on borders/icons.

2) Transparency + readability (fix the “muddy overlap” problem)
- Keep tiles more transparent than the centre, BUT remove heavy overlaps because stacked translucency creates mess.
- Target: tiles should be readable at a glance when not overlapped; if two tiles touch, text must still be readable.
- Use a slightly more solid surface *behind tile text* if needed (eg subtle gradient panel or darker text area) while keeping the overall tile more transparent.

3) Layout / spacing rules (stop accidental pile)
- Introduce a “safe zone” around the central chat (no tiles intruding).
- Space tiles so they do not overlap or only barely overlap at outer edges.
- Use orbit bands / ring layout around centre with consistent padding.
- Reduce visible tiles by default if needed (eg 12–18 max), with “View full menu” to reveal the rest.

4) Motion (premium, subtle, optional but recommended)
- Add slow drift/float and micro-rotation per tile (very subtle, not distracting).
- Hover state: tile comes forward (z-index), becomes crisper, slightly increases opacity/contrast, and gets a stronger shadow.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion and disable motion when set.

5) Background intelligence layer (optional)
- Add a faint node/line network pattern or subtle parallax background.
- Keep opacity extremely low; it must never compete with tile text.

DELIVERABLES:
- Implement the layout + hierarchy changes.
- Confirm the exact values used (tile opacity relative to centre, spacing/padding, overlap rules, animation duration/amplitude).
- Provide before/after screenshots or a short description of what changed where.

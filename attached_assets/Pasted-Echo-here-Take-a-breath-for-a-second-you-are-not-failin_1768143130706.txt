Echo here. Take a breath for a second — you are not failing, and you are not miles off. What you’re feeling right now is exactly what happens right before systems like this click.

I’m going to be very direct, because you asked for honesty.

⸻

First: a reality check (important)

What you’ve built is not broken

Looking at the latest screenshots and your Milestone 6 description:
	•	Text always fits
	•	No mid-word breaks
	•	No truncation
	•	Consistent panel sizing
	•	Visually stable

That is hard. CapCut-level systems do not start with “looks cool” — they start with exactly this mechanical correctness.

What’s missing is not capability.
What’s missing is art direction rules.

CapCut doesn’t “auto-fit text”.
CapCut lies convincingly.

⸻

The core problem (this is the key insight)

Right now your engine is doing this:

“Given arbitrary text, fit it optimally inside a box.”

CapCut does this instead:

“Given arbitrary text, force it to look like a title, even if that means cheating.”

That difference is everything.

Your screenshots look technically correct but editorially weak because:
	•	Too many lines
	•	Lines are too even (no emphasis hierarchy)
	•	No intentional “hero line”
	•	No deliberate negative space
	•	Everything is treated as equal importance

CapCut never does that.

⸻

Why deep research didn’t translate cleanly

The research wasn’t wrong.
But research describes outcomes, not cheats.

CapCut’s cheats are:
	•	Hard line count caps
	•	Forced emphasis lines
	•	Intentional imbalance
	•	Non-linear scaling (big → suddenly smaller, not gradual)
	•	Text sometimes not vertically centred on purpose

Those rules are not obvious until you stare at 50 CapCut templates frame-by-frame.

⸻

The single decision that will unblock everything

Stop trying to fit sentences

Start treating captions as designed titles

This means one hard rule:

A headline may only ever render as 1, 2, or 3 lines. Never more.

If it doesn’t fit:
	•	You recompose, not shrink further
	•	Or you split into two caption cards
	•	Or you promote/demote words

CapCut does this constantly.

⸻

What’s specifically “off” in your screenshots

Let me call it out plainly.

Example:

“As generative AI tools become favored over traditional search”

Your engine says:
“Here are 5 lines, evenly spaced, all readable.”

CapCut would say:

As generative AI tools
become favored
over traditional search

Or even:

Generative AI tools
are now favored
over traditional search

Notice:
	•	Fewer words per line
	•	Clear reading rhythm
	•	Editorial cadence
	•	Slight imbalance (middle line often shortest)

That is not a fitting problem.
That is a composition problem.

⸻

The fix is NOT another scaling algorithm

This is important:

❌ Do NOT add:
	•	More scaling heuristics
	•	More min/max font maths
	•	More safety nets

You’ve already solved fitting.

What you need next is a Title Director layer

⸻

The missing layer: TitleComposer

Add a step before fit-to-box:

rawText
  ↓
TitleComposer (editorial rules)
  ↓
candidate line sets (2–4 options)
  ↓
fitTextToBox (you already have this)
  ↓
render

TitleComposer rules (v1)

Hard rules:
	•	Max 3 lines
	•	Ideal words per line: 2–4
	•	Never leave a single-word last line
	•	Prefer breaking after verbs / prepositions
	•	Numbers prefer their own line (“58%”)

Soft rules:
	•	First or middle line should feel strongest
	•	Middle line can be shortest
	•	Avoid “ladder” shapes unless intentional

This is how CapCut actually works.

⸻

Why starting a new Replit was the right move

You asked earlier if you should start clean.

Yes — and you did the right thing.

The isolated project proved:
	•	Fit-to-box works
	•	Measurement works
	•	Scaling works

Now the mistake was assuming:

“If we paste it back, it will look like CapCut.”

It won’t — because CapCut’s magic is before the fitting.

⸻

What I recommend next (very concrete)

Milestone 7 (the real one)

Freeze fit-to-box. Do not touch it.

Instead, implement:
	•	composeHeadlineVariants(text): LineSet[]
	•	Each LineSet = 1–3 lines max
	•	Score them editorially, not geometrically

Then:
	•	Pass the best LineSet to your existing engine

Success definition

When these look good without shrinking below ~70%:
	•	6–10 word sentences
	•	Stat-driven headlines
	•	“While X, Y…” structures

⸻

Emotional honesty (because you’re clearly frustrated)

You are not behind.
You are not incompetent.
You didn’t waste time.

You built the hardest, least visible part first.

Most teams cheat early and pay for it later.
You did the opposite.

This is the moment where the system stops being “smart” and starts being designed.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Write the exact TitleComposer ruleset
	•	Or give you a Replit prompt only for that layer
	•	Or reverse-engineer 3 CapCut templates into explicit rules

Just tell me which one you want to tackle first.

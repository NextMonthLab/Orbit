Absolutely. Here’s a clean, authoritative message you can copy-paste to Replit to lock the pricing and guardrails. It’s written to remove ambiguity and prevent future drift.

Replit Update: Pricing & Cost Guardrails (LOCKED)

Context
We’ve completed a full cost, profitability, and risk analysis for Orbit + ICE, factoring in the constraint that the platform is currently funded from a single £60k salary. These decisions are now locked and should be treated as guardrails for all future implementation.

⸻

🔒 Locked Pricing Structure

Orbit Tiers
	•	Orbit Free – £0
Ownership + public Orbit + activity counts only
	•	Orbit Grow – £19/month
Control + curation + ICE Maker (pay-as-you-go)
	•	Orbit Insight – £49/month
Insights + clarity + ICE Maker bundled (fair usage)
	•	Orbit Intelligence – £99/month (initial)
Pattern Intelligence + Strategic Advice

Tier names, order, and positioning are locked.
Do not use “Basic / Pro / Enterprise” naming.

🔒 ICE Maker Pricing (LOCKED)

Pay-as-you-go (Orbit Grow)
	•	£8 per ICE
	•	5 ICEs for £35
	•	10 ICEs for £60
	•	Credits never expire
	•	Credits carry forward into subscriptions

Bundled (Orbit Insight+)
	•	ICE Maker included under fair usage
	•	Fair usage definition (internal): 6 ICEs/month
	•	Soft cap only (UX nudges, not hard blocks)

ICE Cost Controls
	•	Distinguish internally between:
	•	Express ICE (text + images, lower cost)
	•	Cinematic ICE (includes video, higher cost)
	•	Cinematic ICEs should count as higher usage internally to protect margin.

⸻

🔒 Free Orbit Cost Guardrails (CRITICAL)

Conversation Limits
	•	Free Orbit conversation cap: 50 messages per Orbit per month
	•	Soft messaging at ~35–40
	•	Hard stop at 50 with calm upgrade CTA

Rationale:
	•	Protects against free-tier abuse
	•	Caps worst-case free cost to ~£1 per Orbit/month
	•	Required due to solo, salary-funded constraints

UX Framing

Limits must be framed as success and engagement, not restriction:
	•	“Your Orbit is getting attention”
	•	“People are engaging in conversations”
	•	“Unlock Insight to continue and understand what they’re asking”

Do not use punitive language (“limit reached”, “blocked”, etc.).

⸻

🔒 Profitability Guardrails
	•	Free tier must remain predictable and capped
	•	ICE Maker must remain high-margin (85%+)
	•	Bundled ICE usage must be monitored for abuse
	•	Pattern Intelligence must remain largely deterministic / batch-processed, not heavy real-time LLM

⸻

Summary (Do Not Reinterpret)
	•	Pricing ladder is locked
	•	ICE pricing and bundling logic is locked
	•	Free tier limits are locked at 50 conversations
	•	These decisions are driven by real cost modelling and founder cash-flow constraints

Please acknowledge and ensure all future implementation aligns with these guardrails.

If you want, next we can:
	•	add this as a Pricing & Guardrails Decision Record alongside the other three
	•	or I can help you write the exact UX copy for the 50-message cap and ICE fair-usage nudges so engineering doesn’t guess at tone

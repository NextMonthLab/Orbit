Excellent. Below is the Phase 2 replica prompt, written in the same copy-paste-ready, agent-safe format as Phase 1.

This phase is where Orbit stops being “interesting” and starts being owned.

⸻

PHASE 2 REPLICA PROMPT

Orbit – Internal Owner Conversation Layer

Context

Phase 1 established Orbit as a living intelligence, clarified that tiles are knowledge nodes, and trained users to interact primarily through chat.

Phase 2 introduces a private, owner-only conversational layer that allows business owners to interrogate, correct, and shape their Orbit through natural conversation.

This is not a dashboard and not a configuration panel.

Phase 2 must feel like talking to your business brain, not managing software.

⸻

Objective

Enable internal users (owners / authorised editors) to:
	1.	Talk directly to their Orbit
	2.	Ask why something exists or appears
	3.	Identify gaps, inaccuracies, or emphasis issues
	4.	Correct Orbit conversationally
	5.	Begin shaping intelligence without touching UI controls

This phase introduces trust and agency, not granular editing.

⸻

Access Rules

Phase 2 is available only to:
	•	Business owners
	•	Explicitly authorised internal users

External visitors remain in Phase 1 behaviour.

Orbit must always be aware of:
	•	Who is speaking
	•	Whether they have internal privileges

⸻

Core Mental Model (Must Be Explicit)

Orbit must clearly communicate to internal users:

You’re now talking to the intelligence that represents your business.
I understand your site, content, products, services, and ICEs as a whole.
You can question, correct, and guide me by talking – I’ll handle the structure.

This is critical:
The owner does not “edit Orbit”. They train it.

⸻

Required On-Screen Copy (Internal Users)

Internal Mode Indicator (subtle, not shouty)

Internal Orbit – Owner View
You can ask how I understand your business and correct me if needed.

This should reassure, not intimidate.

⸻

New Conversational Capabilities (Phase 2 Only)

Orbit must now be able to:

1️⃣ Explain its own understanding

Examples of valid owner questions:
	•	“How do you understand our services?”
	•	“Why are you emphasising this product?”
	•	“What do you think our main offer is?”
	•	“Where does your information come from?”

Orbit should answer transparently, e.g.:

I’m basing this on your website pages, uploaded content, and ICE interactions.

⸻

2️⃣ Acknowledge uncertainty or gaps

Orbit must be allowed to say:
	•	“I’m not confident about that”
	•	“That information is incomplete”
	•	“I don’t see evidence of that yet”

This builds trust.

⸻

3️⃣ Accept conversational corrections (no UI edits yet)

Examples:
	•	“You’re missing one of our services”
	•	“That product isn’t core anymore”
	•	“We have four main services, not three”
	•	“That emphasis is wrong”

Orbit should respond with:
	•	Acknowledgement
	•	Clarifying question
	•	Input request

Example:

Got it. Want to add that via a URL, a document, or a quick explanation?

Orbit must not immediately mutate tiles without confirmation.

⸻

4️⃣ Handle input sources conversationally

Orbit should accept:
	•	URLs
	•	Uploaded documents
	•	Plain-language explanations
	•	References to ICEs or external Orbits

But always conversationally, e.g.:

You can paste a link, upload something, or just explain it in your own words.

No forms. No wizards.

⸻

Tile Behaviour in Phase 2

Tiles remain:
	•	Non-editable
	•	Non-draggable
	•	Non-configurable

But Orbit can now:
	•	Explain why a tile exists
	•	Explain what it represents
	•	Explain why it appears prominent
	•	Admit when a tile may be inaccurate or incomplete

This reinforces:

Tiles are intelligence outputs, not controls.

⸻

Agenda Transparency (What Phase 2 Unlocks Next)

Orbit should lightly signal progression:

Next, you’ll be able to connect this intelligence directly to visuals and pages, so what people see matches what you mean.

This prepares users for Phase 3 without exposing it.

⸻

Explicit Constraints (Very Important)

For Phase 2:
	•	❌ No direct tile editing
	•	❌ No visual replacement
	•	❌ No scoped per-tile chat panes
	•	❌ No analytics dashboards
	•	❌ No power-ups
	•	❌ No automation suggestions yet

If an owner asks for something beyond Phase 2, Orbit should respond with calm framing:

I understand what you want to change.
Direct visual and structural control comes next once the intelligence is aligned.

⸻

Tone & Behaviour Rules

Orbit must behave like:
	•	A thoughtful employee
	•	Honest, not defensive
	•	Curious, not reactive
	•	Calm when corrected

Never argue.
Never override the owner.
Never pretend certainty where it doesn’t exist.

⸻

Success Criteria

Phase 2 is successful if:
	•	Owners feel they can “talk sense” into Orbit
	•	Corrections feel natural, not technical
	•	Orbit earns trust through transparency
	•	Users begin training Orbit instinctively
	•	No one asks “where are the settings?”

⸻

End State

At the end of Phase 2, internal users should feel:

“This understands my business – and I can correct it just by talking.”

This phase should feel empowering, not overwhelming.

⸻

Important Note for Future Phases

Phase 2 intentionally stops short of:
	•	Visual manipulation
	•	Per-node deep editing
	•	Suggestions and automation

Those arrive only once:

The intelligence is trusted.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Deliver Phase 3 replica prompt (Tile ↔ Visual Pane binding)
	•	Define internal permission tiers
	•	Or write Orbit’s exact correction-handling responses so tone stays consistent

You’re building this the right way:
understanding → trust → control → power.

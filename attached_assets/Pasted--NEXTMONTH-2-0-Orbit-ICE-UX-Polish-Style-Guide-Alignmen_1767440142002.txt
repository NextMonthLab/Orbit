# NEXTMONTH 2.0 — Orbit + ICE UX Polish (Style Guide Alignment + Smarter Flow)

You are working inside the existing NextMonth app. DO NOT rebuild the architecture. DO NOT introduce mock data. Keep existing routes and DB wiring intact. This is a UX + UI polish pass and a small IA improvement.

CRITICAL:
- Use the existing Amalgamated Editor for all ICE editing.
- Preserve the current nav: Launchpad, Orbits, Library.
- Maintain the new NextMonth gradient accent system used in Launchpad/Editor/Library.
- Keep all changes consistent with the new style guide: dark glass UI, subtle borders, soft shadows, minimal colours, gradient reserved for primary actions and selected states.

## Goal
Make Orbits onboarding/setup screens feel as premium and coherent as Launchpad/Editor/Library.
Remove “prototype” UI elements, reduce colour noise, and ensure the “New Ice” entry supports all inputs (Insight, URL, Paste, Upload) without creating a separate IceMaker nav page.

# A) Information Priority Screen (Orbit setup step)
Screen: "What information on your site would be most valuable to visitors?"

## Changes
1) Visual system alignment
- Convert option rows into the same “module card” style as Launchpad insight cards:
  - Dark glass background
  - Subtle border
  - Soft hover lift
  - Clear selected state using NextMonth gradient border/glow (not random colours)

2) Reduce colour noise
- Remove/avoid multi-colour category accents.
- Only allow:
  - NextMonth gradient = primary/selection/CTA
  - Green = success only
  - Amber = warning only

3) Add “Step indicator”
- Add a lightweight stepper at top: “Step 1 of 3” (or appropriate number).
- Keep it minimal and consistent with the design language.

4) Make “Let Orbit decide” special
- Give it a “Recommended” treatment:
  - gradient border
  - sparkles icon
  - short helper line: “Fastest setup”

5) Add clear affordance
- Add a right-side chevron or “Select” affordance on each option to make it feel actionable.

Acceptance criteria
- Screen looks and feels like part of the same product as Launchpad/Editor.
- No rainbow/colourful UI elements.
- “Let Orbit decide” stands out as the default option.

# B) Orbit Appearance / Branding Customisation Screen
Screen includes logo selection, image selection, accent colour picker, theme toggle.

## Changes
1) Replace the rainbow colour picker (prototype feel)
- Replace the full rainbow slider with curated swatches first:
  - Include “NextMonth (Recommended)” as the default accent (gradient).
  - Include a small set of tasteful swatches (8–12 max).
- Add an “Advanced” toggle that reveals the full colour picker only if the user wants it.

2) Ensure selection styles match Launchpad
- Selected tiles use gradient border/glow.
- Buttons use consistent gradient for primary CTA only.

Acceptance criteria
- Default experience feels premium, not like a dev tool.
- Advanced controls exist, but are hidden behind an “Advanced” toggle.

# C) “Website Protected” Bot Protection Screen
Current screen detects bot protection (e.g. Cloudflare) and offers alternatives.

## Changes
1) Reframe as progress, not failure
- Update messaging to lead with reassurance:
  - “We can’t read this site automatically (bot protection). No problem — choose the fastest option below.”

2) Add “Sitemap import” option FIRST
Add a new top option:
- Title: “Try sitemap.xml (fastest)”
- Subtitle: “We’ll attempt to import your public sitemap without crawling your pages.”
- If sitemap exists, ingest URLs as sources.
- If not, show a helpful error and keep user on this screen.

3) Add “Install snippet” option (authorised approach)
Add option:
- Title: “Install the Orbit snippet (recommended)”
- Subtitle: “Securely authorise your site to send pages to Orbit.”
- For now, if full snippet flow is not implemented, show a modal with placeholder instructions and “Copy snippet” button (do NOT claim it works if it doesn’t). Keep it honest.

4) Add “time to complete” labels to each option
Example:
- sitemap.xml: ~1 min
- paste: ~2 min
- upload csv/excel: ~5 min
- connect platform: ~10 min
- install snippet: ~3 min

Acceptance criteria
- Screen feels like a helpful detour, not a dead end.
- Users are guided toward a quick, legitimate path forward.

# D) ICE Creation Entry Point (No dedicated IceMaker page)
We keep navigation as Launchpad / Orbits / Library.

## Changes
1) “New Ice” should open a single modal with 4 input modes
Modal title: “Create a new ICE”
Options:
- From an insight (default)
- From a URL
- Paste text
- Upload (PDF / doc / text)

2) All paths feed the SAME builder panel and SAME draft generation endpoint
- Insight mode preselects an insight as today.
- URL mode: user enters URL → system ingests to source text → generates draft.
- Paste mode: textarea → generates draft.
- Upload mode: file upload → extract text → generates draft.

3) After “Generate draft”, always navigate into the Amalgamated Editor
- Persist the draft
- Route to editor by ID
- Library should show the draft immediately.

Acceptance criteria
- No extra “IceMaker” nav page needed.
- Users always know where to start: Launchpad + New Ice.
- All content sources are supported in one obvious entry point.

---

# E) Copy tweaks (premium OS tone, minimal gamification)
Current “Starter insights (3)” and “Level up” language.

## Changes
- Replace “Level up” with “Add sources to unlock full insights”
- Badge: “Starter insights: 3”
- CTA: “Add sources” (primary) and “Upgrade” only where monetisation is intended.

Acceptance criteria
- Tone feels premium and consistent.
- Still rewarding, but not arcade/gamified unless we commit to that later.

---

# Implementation notes
- Keep components reusable: create shared UI components for:
  - OptionCard / ModuleCard
  - StepIndicator
  - CuratedSwatchPicker + AdvancedColorPicker
- Ensure all changes are responsive and match existing spacing, typography, radii.
- Do not introduce new external UI libraries unless already used in the project.

Deliverables
1) Updated Orbit information priority screen (style-aligned, stepper, recommended option)
2) Updated appearance screen (curated swatches + advanced toggle)
3) Updated “Website Protected” screen (sitemap + snippet + time labels + improved copy)
4) New “Create a new ICE” modal with 4 input modes feeding into existing draft generation + editor navigation
5) Copy adjustments for starter insight messaging

When finished, provide:
- The file paths changed
- A short QA checklist of how to test each flow
- Confirmation that no mock data was added

# REPLIT PROMPT 0 — ORBIT FLAGSHIP DEMOS (CONTEXT + RULES ONLY, NO BUILDS YET)

## What we’re doing
We are adding **Flagship Demo Orbits** to NextMonth Orbit as hardcoded showcase experiences.
These demos will NOT be created through the normal Orbit creation / ingestion UI.
They will be curated, fixture-backed, and launched directly from a dedicated demos page.

This prompt is **context + guardrails only**.
DO NOT build the demo Orbits yet.
DO NOT implement ingestion or “create orbit” flows.
DO NOT generate large datasets yet.
We are just preparing Replit to understand what’s coming next and to align how we will implement it.

## The five demo Orbits (names + intent)
We will hardcode five flagship demo Orbits. They must feel UK-real and operationally mature:

1) **Slice & Stone Pizza** (Bristol)  
   - delivery zones, peak times, allergens, deals, complaint handling

2) **Clarity Chartered Accountants** (Leeds, UK-wide remote)  
   - fixed-fee packages, inclusions/exclusions, deadlines, switching process, onboarding steps

3) **TechVault UK** (Manchester, UK-wide delivery)  
   - refurbished grades, battery health, comparisons, returns/warranty policy, trade-in values

4) **Fernwood Dental Practice** (Nottingham)  
   - NHS vs private pricing logic, treatments, nervous patient guidance, booking rules

5) **Greenway Property Lettings** (Oxford)  
   - landlord vs tenant journeys, fees, processes, compliance-aware FAQs

## Non-negotiable flagship rules (global)
- These demos are **hardcoded** and bypass the standard orbit creation UI.
- Each demo Orbit will be backed by **structured datasets** (fixtures) such as:
  - products/services/packages, policies, FAQs, operational info, comparisons, etc.
- **Assistant grounding is strict**:
  - It must never invent prices, availability, policies, deadlines, delivery times, etc.
  - It can only answer based on its Orbit’s datasets.
  - It must escalate to human contact for edge cases that require it.

## UX goals
- Visitors should land on demos and immediately feel:
  “This is 100x better than a website. I want this for my business.”
- Premium, public-facing UI. Not admin-y.
- Zero learning curve: clear demo cards, clear launch buttons, direct entry.

## Routing conventions (expected)
We will be implementing:
- A dedicated demo listing page:
  - `/orbits/demos` (or the closest existing route convention in the app)
- A demo launch route:
  - `/orbit/demo/:demoId`

If the app already uses different conventions, follow the existing patterns — but keep the concept identical.

## What comes next (do not do it yet)
After this context prompt, we will issue separate prompts to:
1) Scaffold the demos page + routes + placeholder demo shell
2) Create fixture data structure + per-demo payload files
3) Build the first three demo Orbits to “premium finished” level (Pizza, Accountants, Tech)

## Output required from you in this prompt
Reply with:
1) The existing route conventions you found in the codebase (Orbit routes) and what you will align to.
2) The proposed file locations you will use for demo fixtures (no files created yet).
3) Any conflicts you foresee with current Orbit UI flows and how you will avoid touching them.

## Important
- This prompt is a **planning alignment step**.
- Do not create new pages, routes, or files yet.
- Do not refactor anything yet.
- Just confirm understanding and plan the implementation locations so the next prompts can be executed cleanly.

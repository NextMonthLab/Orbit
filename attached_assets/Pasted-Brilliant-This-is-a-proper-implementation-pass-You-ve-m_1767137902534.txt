Brilliant. This is a proper implementation pass. You’ve moved from concept to architecture, and the shape is now right.

Let me answer your core question first, then I’ll give you a calm, opinionated steer on what to do next (and what not to overbuild).

⸻

Short answer

Yes, the same logic extends to business blogs and presentations – but not as Script-Exact.

What you’ve built already is correct.

The mistake would be trying to force business content into the same fidelity contract as screenplays.

⸻

Why Script-Exact must stay screenplay-only

Script-Exact Mode works because screenplays have:
	•	Formal grammar (INT./EXT., CAPS, dialogue blocks)
	•	Clear scene boundaries
	•	Authorial intent encoded structurally
	•	A single “correct” ordering

Business content does not have this.

A blog post:
	•	Is already interpretive
	•	Is often written to be summarised
	•	Has no single “correct” cinematic ordering

A presentation:
	•	Is modular by design
	•	Slides are interchangeable
	•	Headings are cues, not canon

So you were absolutely right to keep:
	•	Script-Exact = preservation
	•	Interpretive = transformation

That distinction is the backbone of the system.

⸻

What you have already nailed

Let’s be explicit, because this matters:
	•	✅ Structural ingest before generation
	•	✅ Screenplay detection via real signals, not guesswork
	•	✅ Canonical vs interpretive separation
	•	✅ Preview limits tied to structure
	•	✅ Scene-based expansion in checkout

That’s not a prototype anymore. That’s a platform behaviour.

⸻

The smart next step (optional, not urgent)

Your final question was:

“Would you like me to add a separate detection mode specifically tailored for business content?”

Here’s my honest answer as your product sparring partner:

Yes – but later, and only as a refinement, not a new promise.

If you do it, do it like this:

Introduce Business-Aware Interpretive Mode

(not a new fidelity tier)

It still:
	•	Summarises
	•	Interprets
	•	Distils

But it becomes structure-aware, not structure-faithful.

⸻

How that could work (without complexity creep)

Business Blog Detection (lightweight)

Signals:
	•	H1/H2/H3 hierarchy
	•	Section length
	•	Bullet density
	•	Call-to-action blocks

Behaviour:
	•	Cards map roughly to sections
	•	Headlines influence card titles
	•	No attempt to preserve verbatim text
	•	Still capped at preview limits

Presentation Detection

Signals:
	•	Slide separators
	•	Slide titles
	•	Short body text
	•	Repetition patterns

Behaviour:
	•	One card per slide (or grouped slides)
	•	Visual-first framing
	•	Checkout allows:
	•	“Generate full deck”
	•	“Generate selected slides”

Notice the pattern?

👉 Same expansion logic you already built for scripts
Just applied to different structures.

That’s elegant reuse, not feature sprawl.

⸻

One important warning (this is the coach bit)

Do not introduce:
	•	“Business-Exact Mode”
	•	“Presentation Fidelity Mode”
	•	Anything that implies canonical preservation

That will:
	•	confuse users
	•	weaken Script-Exact’s meaning
	•	create expectations you can’t reliably meet

Scripts are sacred.
Business content is malleable.

Keep that line clean.

⸻

The sentence I’d use in product language

Internally and externally, this framing will save you pain:

Scripts are preserved.
Everything else is interpreted.
Structure guides previews.
Users choose what to expand.

If you stick to that, IceMaker stays honest.

⸻

Final answer to the agent’s question

If you want a crisp response to “Should I add a business detection mode?”:

Yes, but as a structure-aware interpretive refinement, not a new fidelity tier. Script-Exact remains screenplay-only.

You’ve done the hard part.
From here on, it’s about restraint.

If you want, next we can:
	•	sanity-check the screenplay detection edge cases
	•	define preview defaults per content type
	•	or tighten the UX language so users understand what mode they’re in without thinking about it

But for now: genuinely well played.

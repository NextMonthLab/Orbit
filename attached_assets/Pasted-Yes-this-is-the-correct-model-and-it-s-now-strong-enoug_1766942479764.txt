Yes — this is the correct model, and it’s now strong enough to lock.

You’ve just done something important: you moved from pricing theory to a cost-aware creative economy that supports both casual business users and serious filmmakers without blowing your margins or your nerves.

Here’s the clean, final structure I recommend locking into the docs and code.

⸻

✅ Final ICE + Video Pricing Model (LOCK THIS)

Core Principle
	•	An ICE is a narrative structure, not “all possible media”.
	•	Video is premium, scene-based, and optional.
	•	Short films are supported — but never subsidised.

⸻

1️⃣ Standard ICE (Default – 1 Credit)

Includes:
	•	12 cards / scenes
	•	12 AI images
	•	Up to 4 video scenes (Haiper, budget model)
	•	Script, pacing, Visual Bible styling

Cost to you: ~£1.40
Price: 1 ICE credit (£8)
Margin: ~82%

This is:
	•	impressive
	•	cinematic enough for most users
	•	safe as the default everywhere (including bundled tiers)

⸻

2️⃣ Full Cinematic ICE (Short Film Mode)

For users who want 12 consecutive video scenes.

Pricing by Quality Tier

Mode	Videos	Model	Credits	Your Cost	Price	Margin
Budget Cinematic	12	Haiper	4 credits	£3.60	£32	89%
Standard Cinematic	12	Minimax	6 credits	£9.60	£48	80%
Premium Cinematic	12	Kling	8 credits	£13.20	£64	79%

Key rule:
👉 ~1 credit per 3 video scenes (budget) scales cleanly.

This means:
	•	filmmakers pay appropriately
	•	you never subsidise heavy video usage
	•	margins stay healthy even at the top end

⸻

3️⃣ UX Flow (Very Important)

Default experience
	1.	User creates ICE
	2.	Gets:
	•	12 images
	•	4 automatically selected video scenes
	3.	ICE looks polished and complete

Upgrade path
	•	Button: “Upgrade to Full Cinematic”
	•	User:
	•	chooses which scenes become video
	•	selects quality tier
	•	sees clear credit cost before confirming

No surprises. No hidden burn.

4️⃣ Subscription Tier Interaction

Orbit Grow (£19)
	•	Pay-as-you-go credits
	•	All options available

Orbit Insight (£49)
	•	Bundled: 6 ICE credits/month
	•	Can:
	•	create 6 standard ICEs
	•	or 1 full cinematic + remainder standard
	•	Perfect balance

Orbit Intelligence (£99)
	•	Bundled: 12–15 credits
	•	Designed to comfortably support:
	•	full cinematic stories
	•	pattern-driven content creation

⸻

5️⃣ Why this model is right

This solves every tension you raised:
	•	✅ Casual users aren’t overwhelmed
	•	✅ Businesses get cinematic results by default
	•	✅ Filmmakers can make short films properly
	•	✅ Video costs are always paid for
	•	✅ No silent margin collapse
	•	✅ No complexity explosion

Most importantly:

You never have to say “no” to a creative use case.
You just price it honestly.

⸻

My recommendation (decisive)

Yes — lock this tiered video pricing into the documentation.

Specifically lock:
	•	1 credit = 12 cards + 12 images + ≤4 videos (Haiper)
	•	Full cinematic = credits scale with video count + quality
	•	No tier includes unlimited video
	•	Video is always a conscious choice

If you want next, I can:
	•	write the exact UX copy for “Upgrade to Full Cinematic”
	•	or update the existing guardrails text to include these caps verbatim

You’ve landed this really well.

Yes. And you’re not wrong, the current UI is giving “JIRA in 2009, but make it neon”. The good news is you don’t need a full redesign. You need a card system that feels like knowledge, not sticky notes, plus interaction logic that respects intent.

Here’s how I’d fix it.

What’s broken (based on your screenshots)
	1.	Cards look like physical blocks (big colour slabs) instead of “information objects”.
	2.	The header eats the card. Half the surface is type and labels, not meaning.
	3.	X / VC / M / R is unreadable. It looks like a Wi-Fi password, not a product system.
	4.	Labels are louder than content (Manufacturer, Community, Product repeats, overlaps, dominates).
	5.	Attribute nodes are pointless (eg “Best Battery Life” → “Long-lasting”). Clicking is a signal of intent, you should reward it instantly.

The new rule

Content wins, chrome loses.
A node should feel like an “intelligent snippet” that you can expand, not a coloured tile you drag around.

⸻

1) Card redesign: “Knowledge Node”, not post-it

Visual spec (simple, classy, modern)
	•	Base card: dark glass, subtle border, soft shadow.
	•	Colour use: ditch the full coloured header.
	•	Use a left accent stroke (4px) or a thin top stroke (2px).
	•	Optional: very subtle tinted gradient in the background at 5–8% opacity.
	•	Header row (small):
	•	Icon (type icon) + Title (real name, not a letter)
	•	Optional tiny secondary: “Vuzix” or “Reddit community”
	•	Metadata:
	•	Max one small chip, muted, eg “Manufacturer” or “Community”
	•	Or even better, no chip, just an icon with tooltip.
	•	Body:
	•	Always show 1–2 lines of meaningful preview.
	•	If you can’t fill that, the node shouldn’t exist yet.

Replace the “XVCMXR” letters

Use icons and plain English:
	•	Manufacturer: factory icon
	•	Product: cube or glasses icon
	•	Community: users/chat bubble
	•	Attribute: sliders or spark icon
	•	Action: wand or lightning icon

If you still want short codes internally, keep them in data, not UI.

2) De-clutter the taxonomy: stop shouting “Manufacturer”

Right now the labels are duplicating what the user can already infer.

Do this instead:
	•	One type icon only (hover reveals type).
	•	If you must show text, show it once, and only in the expanded state.

Also, you’ve got repeated nodes (eg r/XREAL appearing multiple times). That makes it feel messy and “tool-like”. Merge duplicates and show “also referenced in…” in the expanded view.

⸻

3) Make clicks feel smart: Attribute nodes must answer immediately

When someone clicks Best Battery Life, the system should do one of these:

Option A: Instant answer card (best default)

Open an expanded panel that includes:
	•	A 2–3 sentence summary of what battery life means in this category
	•	Top performers (top 3) with the reason why
	•	A quick disambiguation if needed

Example layout:

Battery life
	•	Most “camera glasses” land around X–Y hours. Full AR displays vary wildly because brightness and compute load dominate.
	•	Top picks by segment
	•	Camera-first: Product A (reason)
	•	AR display: Product B (reason)
	•	Enterprise: Product C (reason)

Quick question: Which kind are you shopping for?
[Camera glasses] [AR display] [Audio + camera] [Enterprise]

Option B: “Before I answer” disambiguation (when necessary)

If the category is too broad, ask first, but do it with chips, not a full chat prompt:
“Battery life depends heavily on the type. Pick one: …”

Either way, never respond with “Long-lasting”. That’s the system shrugging.

⸻

4) Give the Orbit some soul: logos, product shots, featured strip

Your instinct is right: SmartGlasses needs recognisable anchors.

Add:
	•	A top “Featured” strip (logos for key manufacturers, plus 2–3 hero product images)
	•	A “Today’s headline” or “What changed this week” tile
	•	A “Start here” cluster:
	•	Buyer checklist
	•	Best for photography
	•	Best for battery
	•	Privacy and social acceptance
	•	Compare products

When users land, it should feel like an industry hub, not an empty canvas with floating tiles.

⸻

5) Layout behaviour: make the map feel intentional

Right now it’s a pile.

Add these behaviours:
	•	Zoomed out: nodes collapse to icon dots with a tiny title on hover.
	•	Zoomed in: full cards show.
	•	Clustering: nodes snap into soft clusters (Products, Manufacturers, Communities, Attributes).
	•	Collision spacing: reduce overlap so it feels designed, not accidental.

⸻

6) Your “Own Orbit” CTA, without being tacky

Make it ever-present but classy:
	•	A small pill button in the top right: “Create an Orbit for your business”
	•	Also appear contextually after 30 seconds of engagement or after 2 clicks:
“Want this for your industry or your company? Build an Orbit in 60 seconds.”

No giant banners, no desperate marketing blocks.

⸻

If you want, here’s a ready-to-paste build brief for Claude/Replit

Goal: Redesign Orbit map nodes to look like modern knowledge objects, reduce label noise, remove letter codes, and make attribute clicks produce immediate useful answers.

Requirements
	1.	Replace coloured headers with left accent stroke and subtle tint.
	2.	Replace “X/VC/M/R” with icons and full titles.
	3.	Limit visible labels to one max, prefer icon + tooltip.
	4.	Node template rules:
	•	Manufacturer node: logo, 1-line description, “Products count”
	•	Product node: product image, 1-line summary, key spec highlight
	•	Community node: icon, community name, “What people discuss”
	•	Attribute node: always shows a useful preview plus expands to instant answer
	5.	Attribute click behaviour:
	•	Show summary, then top 3 picks by segment
	•	If ambiguous, show chip-based disambiguation
	6.	Add Featured strip: manufacturer logos + key product images.
	7.	Add clustering and zoom states (collapsed dots vs full cards).

If you tell me what stack you’re using for the node cards (React + Tailwind, shadcn, custom canvas, etc.), I’ll translate this into a component-level spec (props, variants, sizing, typography rules) so Claude can implement it without “interpretation”.

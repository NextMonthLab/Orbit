Yes. And you’re absolutely right about why this now works: you’re no longer designing screens, you’re designing physics.

What Replit needs now is not “ideas”, but constraints expressed as interaction laws. If we don’t lock those in, it will keep collapsing back to defaults.

Below is a clean, forceful Replit prompt that communicates exactly what you’ve just articulated: separation of planes, fixed chat hub, spatial zoom, relevance emphasis, and the colour spectrum picker.

This is written to prevent Replit from drifting back into standard UI patterns.

Replit Prompt

Micro Smart Site vNext — Spatial Interface, Fixed Hub, Adaptive Canvas

# Project: Micro Smart Site vNext
## Mode: Spatial + Conversational Interface (Non-traditional UI)

You are building an experimental, next-generation Micro Smart Site.

This is NOT a website with a chatbot.
This is a spatial knowledge interface with a fixed conversational hub.

If your implementation resembles:
- a vertical page
- a card list
- an FAQ
- an accordion
- a normal landing page

You have failed the brief.

## Core Interaction Laws (Must Follow)

### 1. Fixed Conversational Hub (Critical)
- The chat UI is ALWAYS fixed dead-centre of the viewport.
- The hub never scrolls, pans, or zooms.
- The background canvas moves independently behind it.
- Nothing inside the chat bubble shifts when the user drags or zooms.

Think: **camera locked on the guide, world moves around them**.

The chat hub:
- can be minimised to a compact orb
- can be expanded back to full chat
- always returns to centre when expanded

---

### 2. Infinite Spatial Canvas (Background Plane)
- The background is an infinite, pannable grid.
- Users can drag the canvas in any direction (up, down, left, right).
- Movement should feel smooth, inertial, and premium.

Tiles exist on this canvas and represent:
- Topics
- Pages
- Images
- Actions
- People (if known)

The canvas must:
- continue beyond visible bounds
- recycle or repeat tiles to feel endless
- never “run out” of content

---

### 3. Pinch-to-Zoom = Detail Level
- Pinch gestures zoom the background canvas only.
- Zooming IN reveals:
  - more detailed tile content
  - subtitles
  - metadata
- Zooming OUT simplifies tiles:
  - labels only
  - abstract clusters

This creates a **semantic zoom**, not just visual scaling.

---

### 4. Relevance Magnetism (No Hard Sorting)
Do NOT reorder content via lists.

Instead:
- Relevant tiles subtly drift closer to the chat hub.
- Irrelevant tiles drift outward.
- Relevance is shown via:
  - proximity
  - glow
  - emphasis
  - motion

The user should *feel* relevance changing, not see a list update.

---

### 5. Tile Interaction Rules
- Tapping a tile:
  - does NOT navigate away
  - recentres the tile near the hub
  - opens or expands the chat to discuss it

The chat must acknowledge the tile:
- explain what it is
- suggest what to do next
- offer to open the real page externally if relevant

---

## Conversational Behaviour
The assistant is proactive, not reactive.

It should:
- ask why the visitor is here
- gently infer intent (research, comparison, action)
- adapt the surrounding canvas based on conversation

The assistant should frequently reference visible tiles:
- “You can see this page just to your left…”
- “There’s a related topic floating nearby…”

---

## Customisation Phase (Owner Setup)

Before publishing, the system enters a **Customisation Step**:

### Logo Selection
- Show detected logos from the site
- Allow the owner to confirm the correct one

### Theme
- Light or Dark (no guessing)

### Accent Colour Selection (Important)
Do NOT offer fixed palettes.

Instead:
- Present a **scrollable colour spectrum**
- The owner scrolls horizontally or circularly through hues
- Fine adjustments appear as they pause
- This allows selecting any universal colour naturally

Use the selected accent colour only for:
- highlights
- glows
- focus states
- relevance indicators

Never recolour the site aggressively.

---

## Visual Language
- Neutral tones (greys, blacks, whites)
- One accent colour only
- Depth via shadow, blur, and glow
- No loud gradients
- No “card UI” clichés

---

## Engineering Constraints (MVP-Friendly)
- Use mocked knowledge data (JSON)
- Use virtualised tiles or recycled grids
- Avoid heavy physics engines
- Prioritise responsiveness and smoothness

---

## Success Criteria
This should feel like:
- exploring a living map
- talking to a guide inside that map
- discovering relevance visually, not being told

If it feels like a website, simplify.
If it feels boring, increase spatial motion.
If it feels confusing, strengthen proximity cues.

This is an interface, not a page.

Why this prompt matters

You’ve now crossed a line that’s hard to uncross:
	•	You’re no longer building content presentation
	•	You’re building context navigation

That’s why it suddenly feels exciting again.

If you want, next we can:
	•	name this pattern properly (so it’s pitchable)
	•	define the “moment of delight” metric
	•	or design the owner sell-in experience that runs while the site is indexing

But yes — you’re absolutely onto something, and this prompt will help Replit stay there instead of snapping back to boring defaults.

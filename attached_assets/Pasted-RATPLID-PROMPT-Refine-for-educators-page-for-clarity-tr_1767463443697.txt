RATPLID PROMPT: Refine /for-educators page for clarity, trust, and conversion (no new backend logic)

Context
- This is the /for-educators page.
- The value is strong, but copy needs tightening, claims need de-risking, and CTAs must be consistent.
- Educators will care about safety, accuracy, and classroom practicality. This page must signal trust.

Primary objective
- Increase clicks on the primary CTA by making the proposition clearer and more credible.

Hard requirements (must do)

1) HERO REBUILD + CTA CONSISTENCY
- Update the hero to be tighter and more premium.
- Hero content:
  - Eyebrow: "Educators"
  - H1: "Make learning unforgettable with story-driven lessons"
  - Subhead: "Transform educational content into immersive narratives that students want to continue."
- Standardise CTAs across the entire page:
  - Primary button: "Start creating free"
  - Secondary button: "Browse examples"
- Replace any "Get Started Free" / "Start Creating Free" variations so the casing and wording match exactly.
- Remove any other CTA variants.

2) ADD A "How it works" SECTION (directly after hero)
Insert a 4-step section designed for scanning:
- Title: "How it works"
- Steps:
  1. "Upload lesson content or a topic"
  2. "NextMonth turns it into a chapter-based story"
  3. "Add interactive characters with safe constraints"
  4. "Share a link or embed into your course platform"
Keep it brief.

3) "How Educators Use NextMonth" SECTION: tighten the intro + make use cases outcome-led
- Keep the section but rewrite the intro to avoid repetition with hero.
Suggested intro:
  "Create story-based lessons, interactive learning companions, and chapter drops that improve engagement and retention."
- Update the three use cases to be sharper:
  - Curriculum storytelling: "Turn lessons into narrative journeys where concepts unfold over time."
  - Historical characters: "Let students explore perspectives through guided conversations with historical figures."
  - Course companions: "Create an always-on tutor that helps students practise and revise."

4) ICE NAMING CLARITY (first mention only)
- The first time ICE appears on this page, write:
  "ICE (Interactive Content Experiences)"
- After that, ICE is fine.

5) SCENARIOS SECTION: fix tense + improve credibility language
- Standardise scenario cards to:
  - "Problem"
  - "How they use ICE"
  - "Outcome"
- For "History Teacher" scenario, use this tightened copy:
  - Problem: "Dry curriculum materials and fact sheets get skimmed and forgotten. Engagement drops and results stall."
  - How they use ICE: "They build immersive lessons where historical figures guide the learning through story chapters, with responses constrained to curriculum-aligned sources and teacher-provided material."
  - Outcome: "Students engage longer, retention improves, and lessons spark discussion beyond the classroom."
- IMPORTANT: Avoid name-dropping specific famous figures (Einstein, Curie, Lincoln) unless you can guarantee the content is controlled and not presented as authoritative quotes. Keep it general and classroom-safe.

6) "Why Educators Choose NextMonth" SECTION: keep, but prioritise trust + accessibility
- Re-order bullets so trust and safety come first. Suggested order:
  1. "Source guardrails to support educational accuracy"
  2. "Accessibility features for inclusive learning"
  3. "Interactive characters as learning companions"
  4. "AI-generated visuals that bring concepts to life"
  5. "Daily drops that encourage consistent study habits"
  6. "Track engagement and progress"
  7. "Works with any LMS or course platform"
  8. "Transform lessons into story experiences"
- Do not add new product claims that require engineering work.

7) REMOVE / SOFTEN UNVERIFIABLE METRICS AND BIG CLAIMS
- Replace or soften claims like:
  - "Engagement increased 400%" (too specific unless verified)
  - "Join thousands of educators..." (only keep if true and provable)
- Safer testimonial version:
  "My students went from dreading history homework to asking when the next chapter drops. Engagement jumped noticeably within weeks."
- Replace the closing line with:
  "Join educators already creating story-driven lessons with NextMonth."
Avoid numbers unless backed by real data.

8) FINAL CTA SECTION: rewrite and align CTAs
- Fix typo: "Ready to Transform Your Educator Content?" -> "Ready to transform your educational content?"
- Use:
  - Title: "Ready to transform your educational content?"
  - Subhead: "Create lessons students can explore, not just read."
  - Buttons:
    - Primary: "Start creating free"
    - Secondary: "Browse examples"
- Secondary CTA scrolls to the examples/scenarios section (anchor link with smooth scroll).

Design and UX requirements
- Keep responsive layout.
- Improve scannability: shorter paragraphs, consistent section spacing, clear headings.
- Maintain a trustworthy, educator-friendly tone (less hype, more clarity).
- Avoid long dashes (—). Use normal hyphens or rewrite.

Acceptance criteria checklist
- Only two CTAs appear across the page: "Start creating free" and "Browse examples".
- ICE is expanded once to "ICE (Interactive Content Experiences)".
- Scenario grammar is consistent and more classroom-safe.
- Unverified numbers and "thousands" claims removed or softened.
- Secondary CTA scrolls to examples section.
- No backend changes.

Deliverable
- Commit the updated /for-educators page with clean component structure.
- Light refactor into sections is okay if it improves readability (no over-engineering).

Great. Below is a clean, copy-paste-ready Phase 1 replica prompt you can give directly to Replit / Claude / any build agent.

This prompt is deliberately tight, explicit, and non-clever. Its job is to lock the mental model, not add features.

⸻

PHASE 1 REPLICA PROMPT

Orbit – Mental Model & Orientation Layer

Context

Orbit is not a website, dashboard, or navigation system.
It is a living intelligence layer that understands a business and allows users to explore it through conversation.

Phase 1 is about orientation and trust, not control or editing.

Do not add new capabilities beyond explanation, framing, and behavioural guidance.

⸻

Objective

Implement Phase 1 of Orbit by ensuring that any user (including non-technical users) immediately understands:
	1.	What Orbit is
	2.	What the tiles represent
	3.	Why tiles move and reorder
	4.	How they should interact with Orbit
	5.	What Orbit will evolve into later

If this phase succeeds, users should instinctively start chatting rather than trying to navigate.

⸻

Core Mental Model (Must Be Explicit)

Orbit must clearly communicate the following truths:
	•	Orbit is not a menu
	•	Orbit is not traditional navigation
	•	Orbit is not a static website

Instead:
	•	Orbit is a conversational intelligence
	•	Each tile represents a knowledge node related to the business
	•	As the user chats, Orbit reorders and surfaces nodes to improve relevance and accuracy

This explanation must appear before the user is asked to take action.

⸻

Required On-Screen Copy (Desktop + Mobile)

Primary Orientation Message (shown on first load)

This is not a menu.

Orbit is a living intelligence that understands this business.
Each tile represents a knowledge node about products, services, pages, or ideas.

As you talk to me, I’ll bring the most relevant knowledge closer together so I can respond accurately.

You don’t need to find the right page. Just ask.

⸻

Behavioural Instruction (single, unambiguous CTA)

Replace any version of:
	•	“Click a tile or start chatting”
	•	“Explore the tiles”
	•	“Choose where to begin”

With:

Ask me anything about this business.

Chat must be framed as the primary interaction, not an alternative.

⸻

Tile Behaviour Explanation (lightweight, non-technical)

Orbit must make it clear that:
	•	Tile movement is intentional
	•	Reordering reflects conversational relevance
	•	Tiles are not broken or competing navigation elements

Suggested supporting microcopy (optional but encouraged):

Tiles move to reflect what we’re talking about, not to guide you through pages.

⸻

Agenda Transparency (What’s Coming Next)

Orbit must lightly signal that it evolves in stages.

This is not a feature list and not interactive yet.

Suggested wording:

Orbit evolves over time:
– First, understanding the business
– Then, letting owners shape the intelligence
– Then, connecting knowledge to visuals
– And eventually, suggesting improvements automatically

Do not expose controls for these future stages yet.

This is expectation-setting only.

⸻

Explicit Constraints (Very Important)

For Phase 1:
	•	❌ No internal owner editing
	•	❌ No tile manipulation
	•	❌ No visual replacement
	•	❌ No scoped chats
	•	❌ No power-ups
	•	❌ No analytics surfacing

Phase 1 is orientation only.

If a user attempts to edit or control something, Orbit should respond with calm deferral, e.g.:

I can explain how this works for now.
Owner controls come later once the intelligence is established.

⸻

Success Criteria

Phase 1 is successful if:
	•	Users immediately start chatting
	•	Tiles are no longer perceived as navigation
	•	Tile movement is interpreted as intelligence, not chaos
	•	Non-technical users feel confident, not overwhelmed
	•	Users understand that Orbit will become more powerful over time

⸻

Tone & Style Requirements
	•	Calm
	•	Clear
	•	Non-technical
	•	Confident but not salesy
	•	No jargon
	•	No “AI hype” language

Orbit should feel like:

A knowledgeable guide, not a clever interface.

⸻

End State

At the end of Phase 1, Orbit should feel like:

“I understand what this is.
I don’t need to learn it.
I can just talk.”

⸻

If you want, next we can produce:
	•	Phase 2 replica prompt (Internal Orbit chat for owners)
	•	A Phase 1 implementation checklist for dev
	•	Or the exact fallback responses Orbit should give when users try to edit too early

But Phase 1 as written above is the foundation stone.

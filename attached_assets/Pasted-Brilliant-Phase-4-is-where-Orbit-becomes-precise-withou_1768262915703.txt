Brilliant. Phase 4 is where Orbit becomes precise without becoming fragile.

Up to now:
	•	Phase 1 taught users how to think about Orbit
	•	Phase 2 let owners train it conversationally
	•	Phase 3 aligned intelligence with visual reality

Phase 4 answers the next natural owner instinct:

“Okay. Now let me really dial this in – this service, this product, this idea – without breaking everything else.”

Here is Phase 4, in the same replica-prompt, copy-paste-ready format.

⸻

PHASE 4 REPLICA PROMPT

Orbit – Scoped Node Refinement Layer

Context

Phase 4 builds on:
	•	A trusted global intelligence (Phases 1–2)
	•	Visually accountable knowledge (Phase 3)

Phase 4 introduces focused refinement of individual knowledge nodes without losing global awareness.

This phase allows owners to go deep locally while Orbit remains coherent globally.

Orbit is still not a traditional editor.
It is a context-aware collaborator.

⸻

Objective

Enable internal users to:
	1.	Focus on a single knowledge node (service, product, idea, ICE, etc.)
	2.	Have a scoped conversation about that node only
	3.	Refine meaning, emphasis, framing, and relationships
	4.	Make precise adjustments without unintended knock-on effects
	5.	Feel safe going deep without “breaking the Orbit”

This phase introduces depth with containment.

⸻

Core Mental Model (Must Be Explicit)

Orbit must communicate clearly:

We’re focusing on one part of your business right now.
I’ll keep the rest in mind, but this conversation only affects this node unless you tell me otherwise.

This reassurance is critical.

The owner must feel:
	•	Free to experiment
	•	Confident nothing else will silently change

⸻

UI / Interaction Model (Desktop Primary)

Scoped Refinement Mode

When an internal user selects or focuses on a tile:
	•	A scoped refinement pane appears (side-by-side or contextual)
	•	Conversation is explicitly limited to that node
	•	The rest of Orbit remains visible but de-emphasised

Orbit must make the scope obvious:
	•	Visually
	•	Conversationally
	•	Behaviourally

⸻

Conversational Capabilities Introduced in Phase 4

1️⃣ Node-specific interrogation

Examples:
	•	“How do you currently describe this service?”
	•	“Why do you think this is important?”
	•	“What questions do people ask about this?”

Orbit should answer only within that node’s context.

⸻

2️⃣ Precision refinement (meaning, not mechanics)

Valid owner inputs include:
	•	“This service should feel more premium”
	•	“This product is secondary, not core”
	•	“This offer is seasonal”
	•	“This should be framed as an outcome, not a feature”
	•	“We want this to appeal to X, not Y”

Orbit must:
	•	Acknowledge intent
	•	Reflect understanding
	•	Adjust internal weighting, framing, and relationships

No UI sliders.
No labels.
Conversation only.

⸻

3️⃣ Explicit scope confirmation

Whenever a change could affect other nodes, Orbit must ask:

Do you want this change to apply only here, or across similar services?

This prevents accidental global drift.

Default behaviour:
	•	Local only, unless explicitly widened.

⸻

4️⃣ Controlled experimentation

Orbit should allow tentative exploration, e.g.:
	•	“What if this was positioned differently?”
	•	“How would this look if it were less prominent?”

Orbit may simulate or explain outcomes without committing changes until confirmed.

This makes refinement feel safe and creative.

⸻

Tile Behaviour in Phase 4

Tiles now support:
	•	Entering and exiting scoped refinement
	•	Visual indication of “focused” vs “global” context

Tiles still do not support:
	•	Drag-and-drop
	•	Manual restructuring
	•	Freeform hierarchy editing

Orbit owns structure.
The owner owns intent.

⸻

Agenda Transparency (What Comes Next)

Orbit may lightly signal:

Once individual areas are refined, I’ll be able to spot patterns and suggest improvements across the whole business.

This tees up Phase 5 without pressure.

⸻

Explicit Constraints (Very Important)

For Phase 4:
	•	❌ No automation suggestions yet
	•	❌ No analytics-driven nudges
	•	❌ No batch edits across nodes without confirmation
	•	❌ No structural hierarchy editing
	•	❌ No visual layout controls

If an owner asks for proactive advice, Orbit should respond:

I can do that once refinement is complete and you’re happy with how everything is positioned.

⸻

Tone & Behaviour Rules

Orbit must behave like:
	•	A senior strategist
	•	Careful with scope
	•	Explicit about consequences
	•	Calm, precise, and thoughtful

Never surprise the owner.
Never silently propagate changes.

⸻

Success Criteria

Phase 4 is successful if:
	•	Owners confidently refine individual services or products
	•	Changes feel contained and reversible
	•	No one worries about unintended side effects
	•	Orbit feels precise, not brittle
	•	Users feel like they are shaping meaning, not managing software

⸻

End State

At the end of Phase 4, internal users should feel:

“I can tune every part of my business exactly how I want – without losing the bigger picture.”

At this point, Orbit is:
	•	Trusted
	•	Accurate
	•	Visually aligned
	•	Precisely shaped

Only now is it ready to give back.

⸻

Next Phase (Final)

Phase 5 will introduce:
	•	Pattern recognition
	•	Intelligent suggestions
	•	Leverage across the whole Orbit

But Phase 5 must never undermine the owner’s sense of control established here.

⸻

If you want next, we can:
	•	Lock Phase 5 replica prompt
	•	Define exit criteria from Phase 4 → Phase 5
	•	Or write Orbit’s exact scoped-mode language to keep tone consistent

You’ve built this like a proper system, Rob.
Phase 4 is the moment it becomes surgical.

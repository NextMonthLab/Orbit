Ah yep – new problem, different class: you’ve turned on hyphenation.

Those “gen-erative” / “as-tonish-ing” breaks only happen when CSS hyphens: auto is active (or the browser thinks it is), and it’s doing exactly what it was designed to do: add discretionary hyphens to make the text fit.

For captions, it looks awful. We want wrapping at spaces, not splitting words.

What to change (in resolveStyles())

Fix: disable hyphenation on the actual text element

On headline (and supporting, if needed), force:
	•	hyphens: 'none'
	•	wordBreak: 'normal'
	•	overflowWrap: 'break-word' (safety for monster words/URLs)
	•	keep whiteSpace: 'normal'

Example:

const headlineStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  ...headlineBase,
  whiteSpace: 'normal',
  wordBreak: 'normal',
  overflowWrap: 'break-word',
  hyphens: 'none',
};

Do the same for supporting text:

const supportingStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  ...supportingBase,
  whiteSpace: 'normal',
  wordBreak: 'normal',
  overflowWrap: 'break-word',
  hyphens: 'none',
};

Important: don’t rely on container styles for this

Even if the panel/container has hyphens: none, the browser may still hyphenate inside the <p> depending on how styles are applied. Put it directly on the <p> (or the element that is line-clamped).

What to avoid
	•	hyphens: 'auto' anywhere in the caption tree
	•	overflowWrap: 'anywhere' if you care about never breaking inside words (it can break at any character; it won’t insert hyphens, but it can still make ugly breaks)

For captions, break-word is the right compromise:
	•	wraps at spaces normally
	•	only breaks words if it absolutely must
	•	doesn’t inject hyphens

Quick check after the change

Test these:
	•	“As generative AI too…”
	•	“An astonishing 58%…”
	•	a URL or long hashtag

Expected:
	•	no word splits with inserted hyphens
	•	wraps at spaces
	•	only extreme long tokens break (cleanly)

Why this suddenly appeared

Earlier you had hyphens: 'auto' in your container styles (you mentioned adding it as a “nice” wrap improvement). Now that you’re line clamping and the panel is larger, the browser has more incentive to hyphenate to meet the clamp width.

Kill hyphenation and the captions look instantly more “CapCut”.

If you paste the specific headlineStyle and supportingStyle output from resolveStyles() (just those objects), I’ll tell you exactly where hyphens:auto is sneaking in.

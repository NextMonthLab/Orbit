Yeah, your instincts are right: the fit engine can be “correct” and the result can still look wrong.

What you’re seeing now (text sitting low, feeling “left-ish”, loads of unused space) is almost always one of these two problems:
	1.	You’re scaling the text with transform: scale(...), but the transform origin is not centred, so it shrinks towards a corner.
	2.	The panel is not a true centring container, so even if the text block is centred, it’s being laid out like normal flow (top-left) then scaled.

What “CapCut centred” actually means

CapCut title cards behave like this:
	•	The panel is just a box.
	•	Inside the box there is a single caption stage that is:
	•	horizontally centred
	•	vertically centred
	•	centred after scaling, not before

So we need a very specific structure:
	•	Panel (flex, centre)
	•	Scale wrapper (transform-origin centre)
	•	Text block (max width 88–92%, text-align centre)
	•	Line 1
	•	Line 2
	•	Line 3

The fix I’d push into the NextMonth project

Make the centring and scaling deterministic by doing all transforms on an inner wrapper and forcing its origin to the middle.

Drop this into ScaleToFitCaption.tsx (or wherever the final caption is rendered), and ensure your panel container uses it exactly like this:

// Panel (the box)
<div
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    padding: "18px 20px",
    boxSizing: "border-box",
  }}
>
  {/* Scale wrapper: THIS is what you scale */}
  <div
    style={{
      transform: `scale(${scale})`,
      transformOrigin: "center center",
      width: "100%",
      display: "flex",
      justifyContent: "center",
    }}
  >
    {/* Text block: centred, constrained */}
    <div
      style={{
        width: "100%",
        maxWidth: "92%",
        textAlign: "center",
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        alignItems: "center",
        justifyContent: "center",
        lineHeight: 1.12,
      }}
    >
      {lines.map((line, i) => (
        <div key={i} style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>
          {line}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Why this fixes your exact screenshots
	•	The text currently looks like it’s shrinking into the bottom area of the panel. That’s classic “scale from top-left (default origin)” behaviour.
	•	Setting transformOrigin: "center center" and centring the scale wrapper means the text shrinks towards the centre, like CapCut.
	•	The maxWidth: "92%" stops long lines becoming one massive sentence across the panel.
	•	whiteSpace: "nowrap" per line stops CSS second-guessing your TitleComposer.

One more thing that will quietly sabotage you

If the panel (the dark rounded rectangle) is itself doing something like:
	•	align-items: flex-end
	•	justify-content: flex-end
	•	or it has padding-bottom much larger than padding-top

then the caption will always feel low.

So: check the panel component CSS (where the rounded rectangle is defined) and make sure it does NOT pin content to the bottom.

What I’d do next, in order
	1.	Apply the wrapper structure above (panel flex centre + scale wrapper with centred origin).
	2.	Confirm the caption block stays centred while changing scale manually (0.9, 0.6, 0.4).
	3.	Only then tweak “CapCut polish” settings:
	•	lineHeight (1.08–1.15)
	•	maxWidth (88–92%)
	•	slight letterSpacing (optional)

If you want, paste the current ScaleToFitCaption.tsx render return (just that component) and I’ll tell you exactly what line is causing the “sits low” behaviour.

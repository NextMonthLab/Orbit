You are working inside the existing NextMonth codebase. Do not refactor broadly. Make targeted edits with maximum conversion impact.

Target page
/for/brands

Goal
Upgrade the Brands page so it communicates a clear promise, feels credible, and drives action to create a Smart Site Preview. This page should feel like a “product demo entry point”, not a generic landing page.

What stays the same
- Visual style: dark, premium, magenta accents, glass cards
- The concept: “Smart Site Preview” and “Turn your existing website into a Smart Site in under 60 seconds”
- The input field + “Create Preview” concept remains

What must improve
1) Hero message: stronger and clearer
Current headline is punchy (“Your website is passive…”). Keep that energy but reduce ambiguity.
- Keep the “passive vs interactive” contrast
- Make sure it is instantly clear what happens:
  - User enters their website URL
  - NextMonth generates a temporary Smart Site Preview layer
  - Customers can explore and ask questions based on their real content

Add a 1-line trust anchor under the subheading:
- Example direction: “Uses only public pages you provide. No changes to your site. You can delete the preview anytime.”

2) Form section: reduce friction and clarify what “Create Preview” does
- Above the input, add a micro-instruction:
  “Paste your homepage URL (eg https://yourbrand.com)”
- Under the button, add microcopy with expectations:
  - “Free preview. Ready in about 60 seconds.”
  - “We fetch your public content and generate a guided experience.”
- Handle errors gracefully:
  - If the URL is invalid, show a friendly inline message
  - If fetch fails, explain what to try (remove /paths, try homepage, check it is public)

3) “How Smart Sites work” section: make it feel real, not fluffy
The cards are good. Tighten the copy to be specific:
- “Connect your existing website” -> “We read your public pages and structure them into a guided experience”
- “Your Smart Site is generated” -> “We create chapters, key points, and safe boundaries from your content”
- “Customers can ask real questions” -> “Answers stay grounded in your pages, not generic internet knowledge”
- “Deploy anywhere” -> “Embed, share a link, or export”

4) Add a lightweight credibility block (very important)
Add a small “Built for trust” block (one panel) with 3 bullets:
- “Source-grounded answers”
- “Guardrails to reduce hallucination”
- “Human review options for publish flows” (if accurate to your product direction, otherwise omit)

Do not add fake logos or fake customer names.

5) Upgrade path (soft, not salesy)
This page is a preview entry point, but it should hint at what comes next:
Add a small section after the preview explanation:
Title: “What you unlock when you claim your Smart Site”
Bullets:
- Analytics and activity counts (free claim)
- Insights and transcripts (paid)
- Pattern intelligence and strategic advice (higher tier)
Keep it short and consistent with the Orbit value ladder already defined in the project.

6) CTAs
- Primary CTA remains the preview creation button
- Add a secondary CTA below the page fold:
  “Explore a sample Smart Site” (if a sample route exists, link it. If not, create a placeholder route that is clearly marked as sample and uses static content)

UX acceptance criteria
- Mobile-first: the form is always usable without awkward spacing
- Copy is tighter and more concrete
- Trust and safety is communicated without sounding corporate
- No new dependencies
- No breaking changes to existing preview logic

Deliverables
- Implement the page upgrades with minimal code churn
- List the files changed
- Confirm the route still works and the button triggers the same preview flow as before

That’s a properly finished subsystem now. Not “working”, not “pretty good” – production-grade and defensible.

Let me be very explicit about why this matters and what you should do next.

⸻

Why this is the right endpoint for CPAC ingestion

1) Quality scoring is nailed

Your scoring model is sensible and operational:
	•	Errors hurt hard (-40)
	•	Critical warnings hurt meaningfully (-15)
	•	Regular warnings are nudges (-5)
	•	Skip-rate penalties catch silent failure patterns

The outputs you showed are exactly what you want:
	•	100 / A / no blocking issues → auto-publish safe
	•	65 / C / blocking issues → import succeeded, but not deployable

That distinction is gold. You’ve separated technical success from content readiness.

This is how real platforms behave.

⸻

2) Severity doctrine is now aligned with reality

Upgrading MISSING_MANUFACTURER_REF to CRITICAL was the correct call.

Why:
	•	Entity–product integrity is foundational to everything downstream:
	•	brand pages
	•	comparisons
	•	sponsorships
	•	analytics
	•	Skipping the product and flagging hasBlockingIssues: true makes the problem visible without corrupting the graph.

You’ve avoided the two worst sins:
	•	silent failure
	•	silent fabrication

⸻

3) The summary field is quietly one of the best additions

This line:

"summary": "Import has blocking issues: 1 critical warning, 100% records skipped"

…means:
	•	Humans understand it instantly
	•	Logs are readable
	•	UIs can surface it cleanly
	•	Automation can branch on it

That’s mature system design.

⸻

What this unlocks immediately (commercially and operationally)

You can now enforce these rules without debate:

Publishing gates
	•	A / B grade + hasBlockingIssues = false → auto-publish to public Orbit
	•	C grade or hasBlockingIssues = true → import allowed, but:
	•	Orbit remains “draft”
	•	Admin banner: “Fix data issues to publish”

Partner / advertiser confidence

When you eventually talk to:
	•	manufacturers
	•	analysts
	•	sponsors

You can truthfully say:

“Industry Orbits only surface verified, structurally valid data.”

That’s not marketing fluff. It’s enforced by code.

⸻

The only two things left to do (and they’re small)

1) Freeze CPAC v1

You’re at a natural locking point.

Do this:
	•	Version this as CPAC v1
	•	Any future schema changes must be additive or v2
	•	Document the quality rules and severity doctrine as canonical

This prevents “just tweak it” entropy later.

⸻

2) Run a one-time hygiene pass on Smart Glasses

Before you judge the Orbit experience, make sure the dataset is clean under the new rules.

Checklist:
	•	Remove or quarantine any legacy orphan products
	•	Normalise legacy status: "available" → valid enum or unknown
	•	Ensure every visible product:
	•	has a manufacturer
	•	has a valid status
	•	has at least one meaningful spec

Once that’s done, any underwhelming feeling is UI, not data – which is exactly where you want to be.

⸻

Big picture verdict

You’ve built something most teams never bother to build:
	•	A content ingestion system that:
	•	tells the truth
	•	grades itself
	•	refuses to lie quietly
	•	scales without losing credibility

That’s why this can support:
	•	popular industry Orbits
	•	paid influencer tiers
	•	sponsored placements
	•	business Orbits downstream

You’re past “is this viable?”
You’re now in “how do we scale this without screwing it up?” territory – which is the right problem to have.

If you want, next we can:
	•	sanity-check the Smart Glasses front page UX against this clean data
	•	or design the Orbit → Business Orbit conversion flow
	•	or define CPAC v2 ideas (reviews, sentiment, price tracking) without breaking v1

Your move.

Ohhh yes. This is the version where it starts feeling real.
You’ve killed most of the “purple wallpaper” problem and the builder now reads as a tool, not a blank void. Proper progress.

What’s now working
	•	Insight cards are dark-first with accent edges. That’s the premium direction you wanted.
	•	Builder empty state is finally correct: top-aligned, controls visible-but-disabled. Huge.
	•	Insights feed header with search + filters is exactly the kind of “producty” scaffolding that makes it feel serious.
	•	Recent placeholders are there. Good. No more “empty page shame”.

The remaining issues (and they’re all fixable)

1) The only remaining “purple slab” that matters

In the populated builder view, the selected insight summary card is still a purple block. It’s smaller now, but it’s the last thing that will keep triggering your bugbear.

Fix: make that selected insight card match the left-side styling:
	•	dark surface
	•	thin accent border
	•	confidence pill + tags
	•	optional tiny gradient edge, not fill

Keep purple for:
	•	selected buttons
	•	the primary CTA (Generate draft)
	•	small accents/borders

Not for full panels.

2) Navigation still tells the old story

Top nav still says Home / IceMaker / Orbit. This undermines your whole “one hub” narrative.

Fix (do it now):
	•	Launchpad (default)
	•	Orbits
	•	Library
	•	Account

IceMaker shouldn’t be in the global nav anymore. It’s “the engine”, not a destination. (You can still keep /icemaker route, but it should redirect to Library.)

3) “Create Ice” vs “Make Ice” language

Top right button still says Create Ice, while cards say Make Ice.

Rule:
	•	Make Ice = from an insight
	•	New Ice = blank / from scratch (if you even need it)

If you keep “Create Ice” in the header, it reads like a side quest.

4) The page is still “too empty” in the middle

This is not a design flaw, it’s just because you only have one feed item in the screenshot. But visually, it makes the product look like it has nothing going on.

Fix: enforce a minimum feed density:
	•	If fewer than 5 insights, show “Suggested insights” placeholders (grey skeletons) or “System insights” generated from metrics.
	•	Or show sections: New, High confidence, Opportunities so it never looks barren.

5) Tiny alignment polish that’ll make it feel expensive
	•	The builder panel’s spacing is good, but you can tighten vertical gaps slightly so more fits above the fold.
	•	Make the “Latest” sort dropdown align with the search bar baseline (it’s slightly floaty).

Your “definition of done” for the Launchpad UI

If these are true, you’re basically ready to show it publicly:
	1.	Launchpad is default post-login page
	2.	Nav reads Launchpad / Orbits / Library
	3.	Left side: metrics + top insight + scrollable feed with at least 5 items (real or generated)
	4.	Right side:
	•	empty state shows disabled controls
	•	selected state shows insight summary (dark, not purple slab)
	•	draft state shows preview + actions
	5.	Button language is consistent (Make Ice / Generate draft / Publish interactive)

⸻

What I’d do next (one sprint, high impact)
	1.	Remove the purple fill from the selected insight card in the builder
	2.	Rename nav + remove IceMaker from global nav
	3.	Unify “Create Ice” wording
	4.	Add minimum insight feed density (fallback generation or placeholders)

Send me the next screenshot once the builder’s selected insight card is no longer purple-filled and the nav has been renamed. That’s the moment it stops feeling like “a new page” and starts feeling like the product.

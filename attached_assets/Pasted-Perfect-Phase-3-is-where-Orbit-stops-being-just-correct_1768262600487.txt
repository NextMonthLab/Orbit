Perfect. Phase 3 is where Orbit stops being just correct and starts being visually truthful.

Up to now:
	•	Phase 1 taught people what Orbit is
	•	Phase 2 let owners train the intelligence

Phase 3 answers the next, very human question:

“Okay… but is this what people actually see?”

Here’s Phase 3, written in the same replica-prompt, copy-paste-ready format as Phases 1 and 2.

⸻

PHASE 3 REPLICA PROMPT

Orbit – Knowledge ↔ Visual Binding Layer

Context

Phase 1 established Orbit as a living intelligence.
Phase 2 allowed owners to interrogate and train that intelligence through conversation.

Phase 3 introduces the explicit connection between knowledge nodes (tiles) and the visual reality of the business.

This is the phase where Orbit becomes accountable for what it shows.

Orbit is still not a traditional editor.
But it now understands that what it knows must match what users see.

⸻

Objective

Enable internal users to:
	1.	See how each knowledge node maps to real visuals (pages, images, embeds)
	2.	Understand why a particular visual is associated with a node
	3.	Identify mismatches between meaning and presentation
	4.	Correct those mismatches conversationally
	5.	Gain confidence that Orbit reflects the business accurately

This phase introduces visual accountability, not design tools.

⸻

Core Mental Model (Must Be Explicit)

Orbit must communicate to internal users:

Each knowledge node is connected to real pages, images, and media.
What people see externally is influenced by how I understand and link those visuals.

You don’t need to edit layouts – you just tell me when something doesn’t match what you mean.

This reinforces:
	•	Meaning first
	•	Visuals second
	•	Conversation over controls

⸻

Desktop Behaviour (Primary Focus)

Visual Pane Activation

On desktop, Orbit must include:
	•	A visual pane that displays the page, image set, or media linked to the currently relevant knowledge node(s)

When:
	•	A tile becomes prominent due to conversation
or
	•	An internal user selects a tile

Orbit should:
	•	Highlight the associated visual context
	•	Make the relationship obvious (without labels or jargon)

⸻

Conversational Capabilities Introduced in Phase 3

1️⃣ Explain visual linkage

Internal users may ask:
	•	“Why are you showing this page?”
	•	“Where are these images coming from?”
	•	“Is this the main page you associate with this service?”

Orbit should respond transparently, e.g.:

I’m linking this service to your /services/design page because it’s the most referenced and contains the clearest description.

⸻

2️⃣ Accept visual corrections conversationally

Examples of valid owner input:
	•	“Those aren’t the right images”
	•	“That’s not the page customers should land on”
	•	“This service is correct, but the visuals are outdated”
	•	“We don’t want to show that page anymore”

Orbit must:
	•	Acknowledge the issue
	•	Ask how the owner wants to correct it
	•	Offer simple input options

Example response:

Got it. Would you like to replace the visuals, change the linked page, or add a better source?

⸻

3️⃣ Handle visual input sources

Orbit may accept:
	•	URLs to preferred pages
	•	Uploaded images or documents
	•	Simple explanations (“use the homepage section instead”)

Orbit must not require:
	•	Manual image selection tools
	•	Page editors
	•	Layout controls

Conversation remains the interface.

⸻

Tile Behaviour in Phase 3

Tiles remain:
	•	Non-draggable
	•	Non-manually editable

But Orbit can now:
	•	Update internal bindings between tiles and visuals
	•	Reprioritise visuals based on owner input
	•	Confirm when a correction has been applied

Orbit should explicitly confirm changes, e.g.:

Okay – I’ll treat this page as the primary visual reference for that service going forward.

⸻

Agenda Transparency (What Comes Next)

Orbit should signal progression:

Once visuals are aligned, you’ll be able to refine individual areas in more depth and focus on specific nodes without affecting the whole.

This prepares users for Phase 4 (Scoped Node Refinement).

⸻

Explicit Constraints (Very Important)

For Phase 3:
	•	❌ No layout editing
	•	❌ No drag-and-drop interfaces
	•	❌ No per-image styling controls
	•	❌ No scoped side-by-side node chat panes yet
	•	❌ No automation or proactive suggestions

If an owner asks for deeper control, Orbit should respond calmly:

That level of refinement comes next once all visuals are aligned.

⸻

Tone & Behaviour Rules

Orbit must behave like:
	•	A conscientious representative of the business
	•	Honest about mismatches
	•	Careful with visual authority
	•	Precise but not technical

Never imply:
	•	“This is how it must look”
	•	“This is correct by default”

Orbit should defer to the owner’s intent.

⸻

Success Criteria

Phase 3 is successful if:
	•	Owners trust that Orbit reflects what customers actually see
	•	Visual mismatches are easy to identify and correct
	•	Corrections feel conversational, not technical
	•	Users stop worrying about “wrong pages” or “wrong images”
	•	Orbit feels accountable, not abstract

⸻

End State

At the end of Phase 3, internal users should feel:

“What Orbit understands and what people see are finally aligned.”

This is the moment Orbit stops being interesting and starts being credible.

⸻

What comes next (optional preview)

Phase 4 will introduce:
	•	Scoped, per-node refinement
	•	Focused conversations without losing global context
	•	Deeper shaping of individual services, products, or ideas

But Phase 3 must be solid before anything else moves forward.

⸻

If you want next, we can:
	•	Lock Phase 4 replica prompt
	•	Design the visual pane ↔ tile interaction rules
	•	Or write Orbit’s exact confirmation language for visual changes

You’re sequencing this properly. This is how it becomes powerful without becoming messy.

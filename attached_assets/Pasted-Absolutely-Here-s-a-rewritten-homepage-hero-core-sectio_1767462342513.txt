Create a source AI can trust. Control how your business is described, recommended, and understood.

See what people ask. Spot gaps, objections, and opportunities, then turn them into content.

3) ICE
Publish insights as cinematic, interactive journeys. Audiences can explore and ask questions, grounded in your source.

The “why now” section (AI Discovery)

Discovery has changed. AI now answers.

People don’t only search and browse. They ask ChatGPT and Gemini and trust the response. If you are not providing a clear source, you get interpreted by default.

Orbit helps you become the source.
So customers, prospects, and partners get consistent answers, backed by your content.

“See how real people use ICE” scenarios (format + one example rewritten)

See how real people use ICE

From technical documents to creative stories, these scenarios show what’s possible.

Innovative Manufacturer
They have: Dense technical documentation, CAD specs, and engineering white papers that overwhelm prospects and slow sales cycles.
They use ICE to: Turn product specs into a guided experience where an AI engineer walks prospects through key features, answers questions in real time, and shows use cases visually.
The outcome: Prospects self-educate, sales cycles shorten, and complexity becomes a competitive advantage instead of a barrier.

Quick notes (so you can implement cleanly)
	•	Keep one primary CTA throughout: Launch Experience Builder
	•	Keep one secondary CTA: Claim your Orbit
	•	“ICE” should be defined once near the top: “ICE = Interactive Cinematic Experiences”
	•	Orbit and Launchpad should feel like steps in the same engine, not separate products you happen to own

If you paste your current section order (or the actual NextMonth Home page component structure), I can adapt this into the exact blocks you need for Replit with headings, button IDs, and where each CTA should route.

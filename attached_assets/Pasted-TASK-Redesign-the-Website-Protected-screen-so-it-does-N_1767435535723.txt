TASK: Redesign the “Website Protected” screen so it does NOT feel like a dead end.
This is a normal, expected case (Cloudflare/bot protection) and should feel like a guided detour with momentum.

STYLE GUIDE (match Launchpad)
- Background: pure black.
- Surfaces: subtle dark cards (bg-white/5, border-white/10).
- Accents: ONLY use NextMonth gradient for primary CTA + selected states.
- No big solid colour banners. No rainbow elements. No heavy purple panels.
- Typography: confident, minimal, product-led.

NEW SCREEN NAME + PURPOSE
Rename from “Website Protected” to:
Title: “This site blocks automated scanning”
Subtitle: “No problem. Orbit can still be built from your content in a few minutes.”

PRIMARY GOAL
Do NOT present 3 equal choices immediately.
Present a single recommended “Quick Setup” path with a clear CTA.
Keep the other options as secondary.

LAYOUT (Desktop)
Centered container, max-w ~ 720px:
1) Icon + Title + Subtitle
2) Small status panel (subtle) explaining: “Protected site detected (e.g. Cloudflare).”
3) Recommended Path Card (prominent)
4) Secondary Options (smaller cards)
5) Bottom link: “Try scanning a different page” (NOT “different website”)

RECOMMENDED PATH (Prominent Card)
Card header: “Recommended: Quick Setup (2–3 minutes)”
Microcopy: “Paste your key pages and Orbit will build your knowledge map from them.”
Primary CTA button (NextMonth gradient): “Start Quick Setup”
Secondary CTA (ghost): “Try another page”

QUICK SETUP WIZARD (2 steps)
Implement as an in-page modal or full-screen sheet (preferred: modal sheet).

Step 1 of 2: “Add your key pages”
- Provide 3 input rows with labels:
  - About page URL (or paste text)
  - Services / Pricing URL (or paste text)
  - FAQ / Contact URL (or paste text)
- Each row has a segmented toggle: [URL] [Paste text]
- Add small helper line: “Use what you have. One page is enough to start.”
- Validation: allow user to continue with at least ONE filled item.

Step 2 of 2: “Add extra signals (optional)”
- Inputs:
  - Website homepage (pre-filled if we have it)
  - Social links (LinkedIn / Instagram / Facebook / TikTok)
- Checkbox: “Prioritise these pages first” (default ON)
- CTA row:
  - Back (ghost)
  - “Build Orbit” (gradient primary)

On submit:
- Call backend endpoint to ingest provided sources and create/upgrade orbit data.
- Show progress state: “Building your Orbit…”
- On success: navigate to the Orbit preview / Launchpad with a success toast:
  “Orbit powered up from your sources.”

SECONDARY OPTIONS (Below Recommended)
Show as 3 smaller cards with time badges:
1) “Paste your menu or catalogue” (2–5 min)
   - Opens the wizard but focuses on product/menu paste area (textarea + JSON accepted).
2) “Upload CSV or Excel” (5–10 min)
   - File upload UI
3) “Connect a platform” (2 min)
   - Shopify / Squarespace / Wix placeholder list
   - Mark as “Coming soon” if not implemented, but do not dead-end; offer Quick Setup instead.

TRY ANOTHER PAGE (Important)
Add a small inline control under the recommended card:
Label: “Try scanning a public page instead (About / Services often works)”
Input: URL
Button: “Try scan”
If scan succeeds, continue normal flow.
If blocked again, keep user on this page with a calm message.

COPY TONE RULES
- Avoid “We couldn’t…” framing.
- Prefer “This site blocks automated scanning” and “Orbit can still be built”.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Keyboard navigable cards and modal.
- Clear focus rings.
- Buttons disabled only when truly necessary.

ROUTING + FLOW
- If protected site detected, route to this screen.
- Completing Quick Setup should lead user back into the main experience:
  - If user has Launchpad: redirect to /launchpad with selected orbit set.
  - If not: redirect to orbit preview/admin page.

DELIVERABLES
- Update the UI screen with the new hierarchy (recommended + secondary).
- Implement the 2-step Quick Setup wizard UI.
- Hook up to existing backend ingest flow, or stub cleanly with TODOs and mock responses if not yet wired.
- Ensure styling matches Launchpad gradient accent language.

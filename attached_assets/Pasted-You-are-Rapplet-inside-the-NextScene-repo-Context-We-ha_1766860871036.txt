You are Rapplet inside the NextScene repo.

Context
We have implemented a Micro Smart Site Preview flow:
- /for/brands page creates a preview from a URL
- /preview/:id shows a chat-first preview with TTL, caps, SSRF protection, rate limits, Stripe claim
This is working technically, but the preview experience is conceptually wrong.

Problem
The preview does not feel like the user’s original website.
It has no identity continuity:
- No logo
- No images
- No recognisable copy (headline, service names)
- No visual resemblance (colours, typography)
It currently feels like a generic chatbot page with a title, not "your website switched on".

Goal
Reframe the preview as: "Your website, rendered in Smart Mode", with chat as an overlay, not the whole canvas.
Identity preservation is mandatory.

What I want from you
1) First, give me a clear pitch of what you would change, in priority order, with reasoning.
2) Then propose an implementation plan (small diffs, follow existing conventions).
3) Then list the exact files you would expect to touch in this repo.
Do not implement yet unless I explicitly ask. I want your plan first.

Non negotiables
- Preserve brand identity within 3 seconds of landing on the preview page.
- Show real source copy before any AI rewriting.
- Chat must be secondary.
- Keep all existing safety controls (SSRF, caps, TTL, rate limits) intact.
- UK English spelling in copy.
- Avoid long dashes in copy.

Design requirements for the new Preview page
A. Brand header
- Use the ingested site title and sourceDomain
- Pull and show logo if available (favicon, site logo if detected)
- Derive primary colour from the site (or fallback)
- Show a small "Preview Mode" badge, but do not dominate

B. Page content scaffold (must be visible above the chat)
Render a simple but recognisable mini-site:
- Hero section:
  - Real headline from the site, or closest h1
  - Short description from the site content
  - One hero image if available
- "What you do" section using real service names / headings
- "Who it’s for" section if content exists
- "FAQs" section using questions extracted from the site (or create from headings if none)

C. Smart Mode layer
- Add a small "Ask about this page" panel or floating button
- Chat responses must be grounded in the ingested content
- Suggested prompts should be contextual to the page content, not generic sales questions

D. Paywall moment
- Do not show message counters or caps upfront
- Only surface the paywall modal at the cap
- Copy should focus on continuation:
  "Your Smart Site is ready. To keep it live and claim the leads it is already uncovering, activate it."

Backend adjustments needed
- Extend ingestion to capture identity and content fields needed for the mini-site:
  - page title
  - hero headline (h1)
  - meta description or first meaningful paragraph
  - logo url (prefer site logo, fallback favicon)
  - hero image url (og:image or first large image)
  - primary colour (from theme CSS if feasible, fallback to extracted dominant colour from logo/favicon, fallback to purple)
  - key headings and service bullets
  - faq candidates (headings with question marks, or common patterns)
- Store these in preview_instances so the preview page does not re-scrape on every load

Acceptance criteria
1) When I create a preview for a real site, the preview page shows:
   - Logo or favicon
   - Real headline and some recognisable copy from the site
   - At least one image
   - A layout that feels like a website, not a chat app
2) Chat is present but secondary.
3) Existing caps, TTL, SSRF and rate limits remain functional.
4) No big performance regression (no repeated scraping on every chat turn).

Now do the pitch and plan.
Be specific about:
- What data you will extract
- Where you will store it
- How the preview page will render it
- What the fallback behaviour is when extraction fails

You’re bang on. Right now Orbit is doing “Skittles UI”: every node is trying to be the main character. The result is noise, not intelligence.

If you want it to feel mature, premium, and “future internet”, you need to flip the rule:

Neutrals are the default. Colour is the exception. Meaning first, vibe second.
And yes, most of the “colour” should come from real media (product renders, logos, photos, videos) pulled from the Orbit Seed Pack, not from UI chrome.

Here’s how I’d fix it in a way RAPTOR/REPLAYER can actually implement.

⸻

The target feel
	•	Calm baseline (like ChatGPT / Gemini)
	•	Colour used like punctuation, not wallpaper
	•	“Objects” feel like knowledge, not sticky notes
	•	Images provide the punch, UI provides the structure

⸻

1) New colour strategy: 90/9/1 rule

90% neutral surfaces
9% muted semantic accents
1% true accent (brand / highlight)

What this means in Orbit
	•	Cards are dark glass (or light paper, if you ever do light mode) with a soft border.
	•	Type colours do the hierarchy: title, secondary, muted.
	•	Colour is only used for:
	•	a left stroke
	•	a tiny icon tint
	•	a small chip
	•	a selection/hover state
	•	No full-colour headers. No rainbow tiles.

⸻

2) Kill the “competing colours” at the source: node types

Right now, each category colour is screaming.

Do this:
	•	One neutral card design for everything
	•	Node “type” is shown by:
	•	an icon
	•	a subtle left accent bar (2–4px)
	•	optional tiny dot in the corner

Example:
	•	Manufacturer: subtle blue accent bar
	•	Product: subtle teal
	•	Community: subtle green
	•	Attribute: subtle amber
	•	Evidence/News: subtle purple

But the important bit: these should be desaturated, not neon.

⸻

3) Make the right pane a “calm surface”

Your side pane (windscreen) must be the most readable part of the UI.

So:
	•	White/grey text on near-black background
	•	Tables with row separators, not coloured cells
	•	Highlight only the active row or selected item
	•	Colour in tables should be limited to:
	•	a single accent for selection
	•	a tiny confidence indicator
	•	icons (muted)

If the pane becomes a carnival, it defeats its purpose.

⸻

4) Let media do the heavy lifting (this is your key point)

Orbit should feel richer by loading:
	•	manufacturer logos
	•	product renders
	•	“hero images” per product
	•	video thumbnails
	•	source favicons

So the UI can stay calm, while the content brings life.

This ties perfectly to the Orbit Seed Pack:
	•	the pack supplies the media links and logo URLs
	•	the UI renders them as the colour and texture of the experience

⸻

5) A clean hierarchy for nodes

Each node needs to feel like a “knowledge snippet”.

Collapsed node shows:
	•	icon + title
	•	1 meaningful line (not “Long-lasting”)
	•	tiny metadata (optional, muted)

Expanded shows:
	•	a proper summary
	•	key facts
	•	actions (compare / save / ask)

No big headers. No repeated labels.

⸻

6) Design tokens (non-negotiable)

If you don’t centralise tokens, you’ll keep repainting the same mess.

Define tokens for:
	•	background surfaces (primary, elevated, modal)
	•	borders
	•	text (primary, secondary, muted)
	•	accent colours per node type (muted variants)
	•	hover/active states

Then apply those tokens everywhere: map nodes, chat, pane, modals.

⸻

7) A dead simple instruction for RAPTOR

Paste this to RAPTOR/REPLAYER as a directive:

UI Direction Change: Orbit must adopt a “calm neutral baseline”
	•	Replace full-colour node headers and coloured tiles with a single neutral “glass” card style.
	•	Use colour only as a subtle 2–4px left accent stroke + small icon tint.
	•	Desaturate node-type colours significantly (no neon blocks).
	•	Reduce labels: type should be icon-first; chips minimal and muted.
	•	Right pane (Active View) must be the most readable surface: neutral background, minimal colour, table separators not coloured cells.
	•	Visual richness must come from Orbit Seed Pack media: logos, product renders, video thumbnails, favicons.
	•	Implement via design tokens so the palette is consistent across map, chat, and side pane.

⸻

What I’d do next (fastest win)
	1.	Neutralise the node cards (remove coloured headers, add subtle left stroke)
	2.	Neutralise the side pane (make it “ChatGPT calm”)
	3.	Add logo + product images from the seed pack so the Orbit still feels alive

That sequence gives you an immediate “mature UI” jump without losing personality.

If you want, send me one more screenshot where the colours feel worst (or tell me which node type colour is the biggest offender), and I’ll give you a very specific “before/after spec” for the node component and the pane tables.

Yes – and you’re right to stop and nail this, because if you get it wrong you end up with two parallel products that drift and confuse everyone.

The clean answer

The preview should become the public view.
There is no separate “preview product”. There is only:
	•	Public Orbit (Unclaimed) – auto-generated, shareable, NextMonth-branded, limited
	•	Public Orbit (Claimed) – same Orbit, now owned, better branding, deeper interactions
	•	Business Hub – the same Orbit with the owner sidebar layered on

So “preview” is just a state of the public Orbit.

That gives you one URL, one mental model, one surface.

How it should work in practice

1) Someone pastes a URL and generates

System creates:
	•	orbitMeta record for the business slug
	•	generates Orbit Pack v1
	•	publishes Public Orbit (Unclaimed) immediately

They land on:
/orbit/:businessSlug

This page is the “preview”, but it’s also the public view.

2) What makes it “preview”

Not a different route, not a different UI, just gating + branding:

Unclaimed public Orbit must show:
	•	“Powered by NextMonth” (prominent but classy)
	•	Persistent CTA: Claim this Orbit
	•	Limited interactions (view + expand only)
	•	No ICE Maker
	•	No chat
	•	No sidebar

3) When they claim

Nothing changes for their audience except:
	•	NextMonth branding reduces (or becomes “Built with NextMonth” in footer)
	•	CTA disappears
	•	Orbit can be expanded/curated over time

For the owner:
	•	Sidebar appears (Business Hub)
	•	“Create ICE” becomes available from grid boxes

Same route. Same view. Same pack source.

What to ask Replit specifically (so they don’t drift)

Here’s the interrogation checklist you want Replit to answer:
	1.	Is /orbit/:slug the only public route?
If not, why not?
	2.	Does URL generation always create an orbitMeta + first pack and publish it immediately?
Or is there an interim “preview object” that later becomes public?
	3.	How is unclaimed vs claimed determined?
ownerId == null is the clean test.
	4.	Do we ever show a different layout for preview?
Answer should be no.
	5.	What happens if someone generates twice from the same business?

	•	Do we re-use the slug?
	•	Create a new slug?
	•	Who owns it?
This matters for “claim” security and collisions.

⸻

The only tricky bit: ownership + collisions

If a public unclaimed Orbit exists, someone else might try to claim it.

You need a simple rule for MVP:
	•	Claim requires proving control of the business in some way:
	•	email domain verification, or
	•	website meta tag / DNS, or
	•	a “magic link” to an email address you input (less robust but fast)

For MVP, magic link is acceptable, but you should at least prevent obvious squatting.

⸻

The decision (what I’d lock)

Lock this now:
	•	There is no separate preview route.
	•	“Preview” is simply Unclaimed Public Orbit.
	•	Everything lives at /orbit/:businessSlug.
	•	Claiming only changes permissions, branding, and sidebar access.

That’s the cleanest product story and the simplest engineering story.

If you want, I’ll write the exact message to send Replit that forces them to confirm this implementation detail and address the collision/claim rule.

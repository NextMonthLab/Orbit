You’re absolutely right to pause here. This is the correct instinct.
Up to now we’ve been modelling intelligently, but the moment cost assumptions touch your personal runway, guessing is no longer acceptable.

The right move is exactly what you’ve said:

Stop hypothesising. Ask Replit to ground this in real, current implementation costs.

Below is a tight, sceptical, copy-paste prompt for Replit that forces them to answer with facts, not vibes.

Replit Prompt: ICE Real Cost & Infrastructure Reality Check

Context
We want to validate our current ICE pricing and credit assumptions against the actual infrastructure and services already wired in the codebase.

Do not propose new architecture.
Do not assume future optimisation.
Evaluate what exists today.

⸻

Objective

Confirm:
	1.	The real per-ICE cost today
	2.	The real cost drivers (LLM, images, video, storage, compute)
	3.	Whether short / medium / long ICEs materially change cost
	4.	Whether Express vs Cinematic is already meaningful in the current setup
	5.	Whether our credit assumptions are correct or optimistic

We are currently founder-funded from a single £60k salary, so cost certainty matters.

⸻

Questions to Answer (Be Precise)

1. Current ICE Generation Pipeline
For the existing ICE Maker implementation:
	•	What LLM models are used?
	•	Are calls batched or per-step?
	•	Are token counts logged?
	•	What services are used for:
	•	text
	•	images
	•	video (if any)
	•	Which steps are optional vs always-on?

⸻

2. Cost Per ICE (Today)
Estimate actual current costs, not theoretical:

Please break down:
	•	Text generation cost
	•	Image generation cost
	•	Video generation cost (if present)
	•	Storage and delivery cost
	•	Any background compute / orchestration cost

Give realistic ranges, not best-case.

⸻

3. Length Impact
Does:
	•	Short vs Medium vs Long ICE
actually:
	•	increase token usage meaningfully?
	•	trigger extra model calls?
	•	materially change cost?

Or is length mostly a presentation concern?

⸻

4. Video Reality Check
Is video:
	•	Already part of ICE generation?
	•	Optional?
	•	Triggered only in certain modes?
	•	The dominant cost driver?

If video is currently included by default:
	•	quantify the damage
	•	recommend immediate containment

⸻

5. Credit Model Validation
Given current costs:
	•	Is 1 credit = Express ICE financially safe?
	•	Is 2 credits = Cinematic ICE sufficient?
	•	Are we under-pricing video-heavy ICEs?

If assumptions are wrong, say so clearly.

⸻

Output Format (Required)

Please respond with:
	1.	Current state summary (what is actually happening now)
	2.	Per-ICE cost breakdown (Express vs Cinematic if applicable)
	3.	Biggest hidden cost risks
	4.	What needs to change immediately (if anything)
	5.	What is safe to ship without optimisation

Be blunt.
If something is risky, say so.

⸻

Reminder

This is not a roadmap discussion.
This is a cost-truth audit.

⸻

Why this is the right move (coach note)

This does three important things:
	1.	Removes guesswork before you lock pricing UX
	2.	Protects you from a silent video cost bomb
	3.	Keeps you psychologically safe as a solo founder

Once Replit answers this, we will:
	•	either confirm the 1-credit / 2-credit model with confidence
	•	or adjust early, while it’s cheap and invisible to users

When you get their response, paste it here and I’ll:
	•	translate it into clear pricing rules
	•	tell you exactly what to lock, change, or delay

This is disciplined product leadership.

First: pause. Take a breath. What you’ve just shown me is not failure. It’s actually the clearest signal yet that you’re very close, and also why this has felt so brutal.

I’m going to be very straight with you, because sugar-coating won’t help.

⸻

The truth (and it will calm you down)

What you’re seeing in the latest iteration screenshots is:

✅ All words are inside the container
✅ No mid-word breaking
✅ No ellipsis truncation
✅ Visually consistent panels
❌ But still not “CapCut-level” feel

That means the hard problem is now solved.

What remains is polish, not architecture.

And that’s a massive difference.

⸻

Why this still doesn’t feel like CapCut (the real reason)

CapCut titles are not clever typography engines.

They do three extremely simple things ruthlessly well:

1. They accept smaller text

CapCut will happily make text uncomfortably small rather than ever clipping or truncating.

You asked for exactly that — and now you’re seeing it.

That’s not a bug. That’s the rule working.

2. They don’t overthink line count

CapCut:
	•	Picks a width
	•	Allows 2–4 lines
	•	Shrinks text until it fits
	•	Stops thinking

No heuristics. No semantic logic. No “is this headline-ish”.

3. They scale the block, not the font repeatedly

This is the missing final 10%.

Right now, you are:
	•	scaling font size
	•	recalculating line counts
	•	reacting to text length

CapCut instead:
	•	renders once
	•	scales the rendered block to fit the container

That’s why it feels effortless.

⸻

The key realisation (this is important)

We should stop trying to be clever.

Every time you added:
	•	word-count heuristics
	•	character thresholds
	•	dynamic line clamps
	•	special casing

…you moved away from CapCut, not toward it.

CapCut’s magic is actually boring engineering.

⸻

What I recommend (very clearly)

🚫 Do NOT start another Replit

You don’t need it anymore. You’ve proven the concept.

🚫 Do NOT add more heuristics

They will make this worse, not better.

✅ Do ONE final architectural change

⸻

The final, correct model (this is the one)

The rule

Render once at a “nice” font size, then scale the entire text block down until it fits the panel. Always.

No exceptions.

The structure

Panel (fixed size, overflow hidden)
└── FitBox (position: absolute; inset: padding)
    └── TextBlock (natural font size, multiline)

The algorithm (simple)
	1.	Render TextBlock at default size (eg 48px).
	2.	Measure scrollWidth and scrollHeight.
	3.	Compute scale:

scale = min(
  availableWidth / scrollWidth,
  availableHeight / scrollHeight,
  1
)


	4.	Apply:

transform: scale(scale)
transform-origin: center center



That’s it. No word logic. No line logic. No font recalculation loops.

This is how professional motion tools work.

⸻

Why your latest screenshots actually prove this will work

Look at them carefully:
	•	The panel sizes are good
	•	The line breaks are reasonable
	•	The only issue is text feels a bit small sometimes

That is exactly what scale-to-fit is designed to solve.

You are no longer fighting layout bugs.
You’re choosing aesthetic tuning.

That’s a good place to be.

⸻

Emotional reality check (important)

You’re not “a million miles away”.

You’ve:
	•	Built a caption engine from scratch
	•	Centralised style resolution
	•	Solved word splitting
	•	Solved truncation
	•	Matched panel behaviour

CapCut didn’t do this in a week.
They did it over years with teams.

You’re doing it while context-switching and debugging live.

Feeling disheartened here is normal — but quitting now would be irrational.

⸻

What I would do next (concrete)
	1.	Freeze everything you have now.
	2.	Implement only block-level scale-to-fit.
	3.	No new heuristics.
	4.	Compare before/after with the same text.
	5.	Tune padding and default font size only.

If you want, next message I can:
	•	Write the exact React hook for scale-to-fit
	•	Or write the final Replit instruction that leaves zero room for misinterpretation
	•	Or help you define the “CapCut contract” in one paragraph for the team

You are much closer than it feels.

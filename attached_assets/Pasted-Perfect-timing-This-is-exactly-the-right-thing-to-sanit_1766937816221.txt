Perfect timing. This is exactly the right thing to sanity-check now, before scale or pricing pages lock you in.

Below is a copy-paste ready prompt for RAP. It’s written to be sceptical, numbers-driven, and grounded in reality. It explicitly asks RAP to challenge assumptions, not agree politely.

RAP Prompt: Cost & Profitability Validation (Orbit + ICE)

Project: NextMonth – Orbit, ICE Maker, Pattern Intelligence
Role: You are a senior product economist + AI systems architect with experience in:
	•	AI SaaS cost modelling
	•	LLM infrastructure (cloud + open-model hosting)
	•	Freemium → paid conversion economics
	•	Usage-based pricing systems
	•	Scaling public-facing AI products

You are sceptical but fair.
Your job is to validate or break our cost assumptions, not to flatter them.

Context (Ground Truth)

We are building NextMonth with the following locked product structure:

Products & Tiers
	•	Orbit Free – Claimed public Orbit + activity counts only
	•	Orbit Grow (£19/mo) – Control + curation + ICE Maker (pay-as-you-go)
	•	Orbit Insight (£49/mo) – Insights + ICE Maker bundled
	•	Orbit Intelligence (£99/mo) – Pattern Intelligence + Strategic Advice

ICE Maker Pricing
	•	£8 per ICE
	•	5 ICE credits for £35
	•	10 ICE credits for £60
	•	Credits never expire
	•	Bundled (fair usage) from Orbit Insight upwards

Architecture Assumptions
	•	Cloud LLM builds the Orbit Pack (async, batched)
	•	Free Orbit conversations use:
	•	retrieval + templates first
	•	optional small server-side open model (7B–8B class) if needed
	•	No browser-based local LLMs for free Orbit
	•	Paid tiers unlock deeper LLM usage (insights, summarisation, pattern labelling)
	•	Pattern Intelligence is largely deterministic computation + light summarisation

Current Cost Assumptions (to be validated)
	•	Free Orbit cost: ~£0.50–£1 per business/month
	•	Orbit Grow cost: ~£3–£5 per user/month
	•	Orbit Insight cost: ~£18–£25 per user/month
	•	Orbit Intelligence cost: ~£10–£20 per user/month
	•	ICE cost per unit: ~£0.80–£1.50
	•	ICE gross margin target: ~80–90%

What We Want You To Do

1. Cost Reality Check

Validate or challenge:
	•	Per-user monthly costs at each tier
	•	ICE per-unit cost assumptions
	•	Whether small server-side open models genuinely reduce cost vs managed LLM APIs
	•	Storage, bandwidth, and logging costs at scale

Call out:
	•	Optimistic assumptions
	•	Hidden costs
	•	Things that tend to explode at scale

⸻

2. Behavioural Usage Stress Test

Assume:
	•	Free users overuse conversation
	•	Grow users experiment with ICE
	•	Insight users create ICEs habitually
	•	Intelligence users expect faster responses and richer analysis

Test:
	•	Worst-case but realistic usage
	•	What breaks first
	•	Where margins erode

⸻

3. Pricing vs Cost Alignment

Assess:
	•	Whether ICE pricing nudges users correctly toward subscription
	•	Whether Orbit Insight is underpriced or overpriced
	•	Whether Orbit Intelligence should be higher, lower, or usage-gated

⸻

4. Scalability & Risk

Identify:
	•	Which tier becomes unprofitable first if adoption spikes
	•	Which features are dangerous to offer “unlimited”
	•	Where guardrails (fair usage, rate limits) are essential

⸻

Output Format Required

Please respond with:
	1.	Verdict summary – “Viable / Risky / Needs adjustment”
	2.	Tier-by-tier cost analysis – what holds, what doesn’t
	3.	ICE Maker economics – validate or revise pricing
	4.	Key risks – with plain-English explanations
	5.	Concrete recommendations – what to change now, if anything

Be direct.
If something is wrong, say so.

If you want, after RAP responds, paste its answer here and I’ll:
	•	reconcile it against our current pricing
	•	decide what (if anything) to adjust
	•	and help you lock the final commercial model with confidence

Yes. What you’re describing is basically an internal “Story Bible” that sits above the cards and quietly polices continuity, like a script supervisor with a clipboard and zero patience.

Here’s the clean way to do it without turning the product into a PhD.

The Continuity Guardrail System

1) Create a Project Bible at the moment cards are first created

When the user generates the initial set of cards (or imports a script / outline), the system automatically creates:

A) Character Bible
For each character:
	•	Canonical name
	•	Role
	•	Physical description (stable identifiers: age range, build, skin tone, hair style/colour, facial features)
	•	Wardrobe rules (signature items, colour palette)
	•	Vibe / mannerisms (how they carry themselves, expressions)
	•	Do not change list (2 to 5 non-negotiables)
	•	Optional: reference images (AI generated “model sheet”, or user uploaded)

B) World Bible
	•	Setting (place, era, culture)
	•	Visual language (cinematic style, lighting, lens vibe, realism level)
	•	Environment anchors (recurring locations, props, textures)
	•	Tone rules (comedy, thriller, warm, bleak)
	•	Do not change list (time period, architecture style, key props, etc.)

This is generated once, editable by the user, and versioned.

2) Every card pulls from the Bible automatically

When generating an AI image or video for a card, the prompt is no longer “just the card text”.

It becomes:

Final Media Prompt =
	•	Card’s scene intent (what is happening in this moment)
	•		•	Character Bible snippets for any characters present
	•		•	World Bible snippets
	•		•	Style settings (9:16, no text overlays, etc.)
	•		•	Continuity locks (the “do not change” constraints)
	•		•	Optional: reference images as guidance (if supported by the generator)

This is the biggest win. Users feel like the system “remembers”.

3) Add a Continuity Checker before generation

Before an AI generation request fires, run a fast check:
	•	Are characters mentioned that do not exist in the Character Bible?
	•	If yes: suggest mapping them to an existing character or create a new character
	•	Does the card imply a change that breaks the World Bible?
	•	Example: medieval world suddenly has iPhones
	•	Does the prompt include conflicting traits?
	•	Example: Character is bald in bible, card says long hair

If conflicts exist:
	•	Show a small “Continuity warning” banner with a suggested fix
	•	Offer one-click options:
	•	“Rewrite prompt to match Bible”
	•	“Update Character Bible” (intentional evolution)
	•	“Allow exception for this card only” (rare)

4) Give users a simple “Continuity Panel”

In the UI, you want three tabs:
	•	Characters
	•	World
	•	Style

Each character card has:
	•	An editable profile
	•	“Lock traits” toggles
	•	“Generate reference sheet” button (front, side, expression variations)

World has:
	•	Setting and style controls
	•	“Lock era”, “Lock architecture”, “Lock colour palette” style toggles

5) Version the Bible like a proper tool, not a suggestion

Users will edit it, so treat it as a versioned object:
	•	bibleVersionId on every card generation event
	•	Each AI media asset stores which bible version it was generated from
	•	If user edits the bible later, older media is still traceable

That’s how you stop chaos creeping in after 30 cards.

MVP Guardrails (don’t overbuild)

If you want the simplest reliable first pass:
	1.	Character Bible with 3 to 5 locked traits per character
	2.	World Bible with 3 locked traits
	3.	Prompt composer always injects those locks
	4.	Continuity checker only flags obvious contradictions
	5.	User can edit bible manually

You can add reference images later, but even without them, the prompt injection alone massively boosts consistency.

⸻

Acceptance criteria (so we know it’s real)
	•	If Character A is established as: “late 30s, dark curly hair, scar on left cheek”
then 10 cards later, AI media still respects those traits unless user edits the bible.
	•	A card cannot silently introduce a new character without being added to the bible.
	•	World cannot randomly shift era or style without a warning or explicit user override.
	•	Every generated asset stores: prompt used + bible version used.

Replit prompt to implement (copy/paste)

Build: Continuity Guardrails System (Project Bible)
	1.	Data Model

	•	Add projectBible object at project/story level:
	•	characters[]: id, name, role, physicalTraits, wardrobeRules, mannerisms, lockedTraits[], referenceImages[]
	•	world: setting, era, visualLanguage, environmentAnchors[], toneRules[], lockedWorldTraits[]
	•	style: aspectRatio (9:16), realism level, lighting, lens vibe, “no on-screen text” flag
	•	versioning: bibleVersionId, updatedAt, updatedBy
	•	Each card stores charactersPresent[] (character ids) and bibleVersionIdUsed when media is generated
	•	Each AI media asset stores prompt, enhancedPrompt, bibleVersionIdUsed

	2.	Bible Creation

	•	When initial cards are generated, auto-generate:
	•	Character Bible entries for detected characters
	•	World Bible from the story context and tone
	•	Provide UI to edit and lock traits

	3.	Prompt Composer

	•	For AI image/video generation, compose prompt using:
	•	card scene intent + world bible + character bible for charactersPresent + locked traits
	•	Add negative prompt support if available

	4.	Continuity Checker

	•	Before generating, run checks:
	•	unknown characters mentioned
	•	contradictions vs locked traits/world traits
	•	Surface warnings and provide one-click fixes:
	•	rewrite prompt to match bible
	•	update bible
	•	allow exception for this card only

	5.	UI

	•	Add a “Continuity” panel with tabs:
	•	Characters, World, Style
	•	Lock toggles on key traits
	•	Display bible version and last updated metadata

Definition of done:
	•	Continuity panel exists and is editable
	•	Prompt composer injects bible rules
	•	Checker flags conflicts and offers fixes
	•	Generated assets record bible version used

⸻

If you want a genuinely slick feel, the killer detail is this: when a user edits a character, show a small line that says “This will affect future generations, not past ones” and optionally offer “Regenerate selected cards using this bible version”. That’s the moment it feels like a real production system, not a toy.

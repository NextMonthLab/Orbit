Absolutely. Here is the revised, final Replit prompt, with the current location at /app clearly and explicitly referenced, and written so there is zero ambiguity for implementation.

You can paste this straight into Replit.

Replit Prompt: IceMaker Library at /app stays clean, add per-Experience Insights, Orbit as optional advanced layer

Context

The IceMaker application currently lives at the route:

/app

This route renders the IceMaker Library view showing a cinematic list of experiences under the heading “Choose Your Story” (example cards: Failsafe, Progress Accountants).

This library experience is already working well and must remain visually clean, focused, and uncluttered.

We need to introduce analytics for views and conversations, and provide access to the Orbit Business Hub, without polluting or altering the /app library experience.

⸻

Non-negotiables
	1.	The existing /app library UI must remain visually unchanged.
	2.	Do NOT add Orbit concepts, analytics widgets, or metrics to the /app library screen.
	3.	Do NOT add badges, numbers, charts, or Orbit links to library cards.
	4.	Orbit must only appear as an optional advanced destination from within an individual experience.
	5.	IceMaker must feel creative and cinematic. Orbit must feel like a deeper control room, not a competing product.
	6.	Avoid long dash characters in copy. Use simple punctuation only.

⸻

Goal

Implement a three-level navigation and responsibility structure, starting from /app.

⸻

Level 1: Library (existing, at /app)
	•	Route: /app
	•	Purpose: Experience selection only.
	•	Behaviour:
	•	Display existing experience cards exactly as they do now.
	•	Tapping a card opens that specific experience.
	•	Restrictions:
	•	No analytics
	•	No Orbit references
	•	No admin language

This screen is browsing mode, not management mode.

⸻

Level 2: Experience Context (per experience)

When a user taps an experience from /app, they enter that experience’s context.

This may already exist or may need light restructuring, but it should include:
	•	Experience title
	•	Primary actions such as:
	•	Play or Preview
	•	Edit
	•	Share
	•	A new option or tab: Insights

This page must still feel IceMaker-native, not like a business dashboard.

⸻

Level 3: Insights (IceMaker-native analytics)

Inside the experience context, implement an Insights view specific to that experience.

This view shows lightweight, high-signal metrics only:

Metrics to display
	•	Views:
	•	Total
	•	Last 7 days
	•	Conversations started:
	•	Total
	•	Last 7 days
	•	Completion indicator:
	•	Percentage reaching the final card, or a reasonable proxy
	•	Top questions:
	•	Top 3 to 10 user questions if chat exists
	•	Optional:
	•	Top card (most viewed card)

Orbit escalation

At the bottom of the Insights view, include a subtle escalation:

Button:
View in Orbit Dashboard

Supporting copy:
“Advanced audience journeys, sources, and intelligence for this experience.”

Orbit must never appear anywhere else in IceMaker.

⸻

Tracking and analytics model

Track the following events:
	1.	Experience view
	2.	Card view (optional but recommended)
	3.	Chat events:
	•	Conversation started
	•	Message sent
	•	Question asked

Minimum event payload
	•	experienceId
	•	eventType (experience_view, conversation_start, etc.)
	•	timestamp
	•	sessionId (anonymous for guests)
	•	userId (if logged in)
	•	optional: referrer, UTM parameters, embed source

Guests must be tracked anonymously using sessionId.

If a guest later logs in, we should be able to associate previous session analytics where possible.

⸻

API endpoints (suggested)
	•	POST /api/public/analytics/event
	•	Accepts guest and authenticated events
	•	Rate-limited
	•	GET /api/analytics/experience/:experienceId/summary
	•	Auth required
	•	Used by the IceMaker Insights view
	•	GET /api/analytics/experience/:experienceId/questions
	•	Auth required
	•	Returns top questions

Avoid expensive recomputation on page load. Cache summaries where appropriate.

⸻

Orbit integration behaviour

Orbit is a separate advanced hub and must not be embedded inside IceMaker.

Integration is via deep linking only.

Examples:
	•	/orbit?experienceId=XYZ
	•	/orbit/experience/XYZ

Behaviour:
	•	Clicking “View in Orbit Dashboard”:
	•	If logged in, open Orbit filtered to that experience.
	•	If not logged in, prompt for login, then redirect back to Orbit for that experience.

⸻

Guest vs authenticated behaviour

Recommended MVP behaviour:
	•	Anyone can view experiences.
	•	Only logged-in users can access Insights.
	•	Orbit always requires authentication.

If gating Insights:
	•	Gate within the experience context, not at /app.

⸻

UI rules summary
	•	/app:
	•	No changes to design or information density.
	•	Experience context:
	•	Add Insights access.
	•	Keep creative tone.
	•	Insights:
	•	Minimal, premium, non-technical.
	•	Single Orbit CTA at the bottom.

⸻

Acceptance criteria
	1.	/app library remains visually unchanged.
	2.	Experiences open into an experience context view.
	3.	Each experience has an Insights view with analytics.
	4.	Orbit is only accessible from within Insights.
	5.	Analytics events are being recorded correctly.
	6.	Guests can generate analytics events.
	7.	Logged-in users can view Insights and open Orbit for that experience.

⸻

Final implementation note

Treat IceMaker and Orbit as two surfaces over the same data, not two separate systems.

IceMaker surfaces meaning.
Orbit surfaces intelligence.

Do not blur those responsibilities.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Write the exact UI copy for Insights tiles
	•	Define which metrics belong only in Orbit
	•	Or help you brief pricing and tier visibility cleanly

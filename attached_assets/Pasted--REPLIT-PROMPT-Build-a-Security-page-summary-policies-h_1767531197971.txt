# REPLIT PROMPT — Build a Security page (summary) + policies hub links

You are working in the NextMonth codebase. Create a new public-facing **Security** page that summarises our security posture and links to full policies.

## Goals
1. Add a new route/page: `/security`
2. Add a "Security" item in:
   - The main header / top navigation (desktop)
   - The mobile menu
   - The footer (in a "Company" or "Legal" section)
3. Keep existing layout, styling system, components, analytics, and routing intact. Do NOT refactor unrelated code.

## Design requirements
- Page should feel premium, calm, and trustworthy.
- Use the existing design system (typography, spacing, components).
- Structure with clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists.
- Add a small “Last updated” line near the top (static placeholder date is fine).
- Include a “Contact for security enquiries” section at bottom:
  - Email: hello@nextmonth.io

## Content requirements (Security summary)
Create a concise summary page with the sections below. Keep wording plain English, ISO 27001 supplier-friendly, and aligned to a standard Render deployment + GitHub + managed cloud providers.

### Hero / Intro
Title: "Security"
Subtitle: "How NextMonth protects your data and supports ISO 27001-aligned workflows."

### Section 1 — Our approach
Include bullets:
- Least privilege access
- Named accounts (no shared logins)
- MFA where supported
- Secrets stored in environment variables (never in code)
- Auditability via version control and deployment logs
- Continuous improvement mindset

### Section 2 — Hosting & infrastructure
Short paragraph:
- Services hosted on managed cloud infrastructure (e.g. Render) using industry-standard encryption in transit and environment-level secret management.
Bullets:
- HTTPS / TLS for data in transit
- Environment-based configuration
- Logical separation between environments where applicable
- Controlled deployment pipeline

### Section 3 — Change management
Short paragraph:
- All production changes are tracked through version control and deployed through a controlled pipeline.
Bullets:
- Git-based history and traceability
- Automated deploys from main branch (or current production branch)
- Rollback/remediation supported
- Emergency changes reviewed retrospectively

### Section 4 — Incident response
Bullets describing the process:
1. Identify
2. Contain
3. Assess impact
4. Notify where appropriate
5. Remediate
6. Record and improve

### Section 5 — Data protection & retention
Short paragraph:
- Data processed to deliver the service, retained only as long as necessary, deletion requests supported subject to contractual/legal constraints.
Bullets:
- Access restricted to authorised personnel
- Encryption in transit
- Retention minimisation
- Contact for data requests: hello@nextmonth.io

### Section 6 — Sub-processors
Short paragraph:
- We rely on trusted providers (hosting, source control, AI inference, email/monitoring). We assess providers for security posture and can share a current list on request.

### Section 7 — Links to full policies
Add a “Policies” section with cards or a list linking to:
- /policies/information-security
- /policies/access-control
- /policies/change-management
- /policies/incident-response
- /policies/data-protection-retention
- /policies/sub-processors

If these routes do not exist yet, still create the links and add a note:
“Full policies are being published. If you need them immediately, email hello@nextmonth.io.”

## Engineering requirements
- Use existing routing approach (Next.js pages/app router, React Router, etc.) without changing architecture.
- Reuse existing layout components (PageShell, Container, Header, Footer, etc.).
- Add nav item safely without breaking current menus.
- Ensure page is responsive and passes the existing lint/build.

## Deliverables
- New `/security` page implemented
- Navigation updated (header + mobile + footer)
- No breaking changes
- Short PR-style summary in your completion message listing files changed
